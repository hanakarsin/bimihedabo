The promise was made to the federal government during their secret visit to Aso Rock last December.</p><p>“We are also aware that the Federal government has been lobbying the international community to enlist their support against Biafra liberation but they won’t succeed. Therefore, anybody distracting or causing division in the IPOB family is a tool knowingly or unknowingly working for the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p><p>“The fact remains that Biafra is a divine project. It has gone beyond any single individual, including our leader. Millions of the oppressed Biafran youths home and abroad are now more aware and conscious than ever. It’s only a matter of time. Biafra MUST come. It can only be delayed but certainly not suppressed.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports Kanu has been in the custody of the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Department of State Services</a></strong> (DSS) since his repartriation to Nigeria from where attends court sessions in the charges bordering on treasonable felony and terrorism brought against him by the federal government of Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5JqZqKon5d6orjLnp6eq12Xwqmt0aJkoKemqXqsscSpoKefXaO7ornDomSkmZ6qeqq6jKmpoqufo3qnu9FmqZ6epai2r7OMnJisoF2dvLa%2FxGaZq6GSmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-stone-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Stone - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mom-wont-change-sons-name-inheritance.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Doesnt Want to Change Sons Last Name for Inheritance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
