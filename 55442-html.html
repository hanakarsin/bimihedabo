I also thank my dear wife for his kindness and love towards me. She had told me that, she was waiting for my last son to come on vacation with her from overseas, and she will soon come back to Nigeria. I thank my wife because in all my endeavours, she is the only one that brings me joy. This is so because, if I have any problem and tell her, she prays with me and even ask me to put my hand on my head, and she will call upon God to intervene in that matter. So, I thank her in absentia. I told you how she used to impress me, because she is a wonderful wife when it comes to loving her husband and she cares about me. I have told my children that, my wife comes first before them, I love my wife. I thank her and also wish her God blessings”.</i></p><p>{also_read}</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnaAk2tloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nigeria-has-collapsed-under-your-watch-pdp-fires-buhari.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigeria Has Collapsed Under Your Watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-accountants-wear-green-visors.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Do Accountants Wear Green Visors?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
