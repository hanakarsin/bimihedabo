It is important to keep private affairs out of the public’s reach, leaving the people guessing pretty much for the most part of things, and it is wise to know at what point to stop talking. These are important points to note, very important points.</p><p>The phrase ‘Silence is golden’ holds true in this situation, perhaps more than in anything else for a 21st century celebrity.</p><p>The (ongoing) issues between artiste manager and publicist Tunji ‘Tee Billz’ Balogun and his wife Tiwa Savage&nbsp;have been major trending topics on social media all day today, Thursday, April 28, 2016 and it’s been awkward, uninspiring and everything in between.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt192shj5o9fog.jpeg><p>Critics have stated at various points that Tee Billz and Tiwa Savage make sense together as a celebrity power couple, but insiders say there are cracks in their affair. We didn't read much meaning into this as there's no such thing as a perfect union or love affair. But all of that looks to be changing really fast.</p><p>Until now, it was all speculations and nothing more. But with the infamous Instagram rants from Tunji Billz in the early hours of today, even though now deleted Instagram posts, it is clear there is more to the glamour and shine we see outside the relationship between him and his super star wife.</p><p>Tee Billz embarked on major, unrestrained rantings on Instagram earlier today, talking about his wife’s infidelity and her alleged, previously-unknown affairs with 2baba, Dr. SID and Don Jazzy as well as her failure to treat him good as her husband.</p><p>He eventually deleted the posts but what cannot be deleted is the maligned reputation that will trail Tiwa Savage, Tee Billz and possibly some of the alleged 'culprits' in the ensuing drama.</p><p>This is bad, really bad, more like tragic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7qked81cftv.jpeg><p>At a point in the Nigerian entertainment industry where the international media spotlight is on us, when the industry players are breaking out into major, global leagues with various music deals and collaborative efforts with some of the finest stars of today, the revelations Tee Billz have made today are both unsavoury and unneeded.</p><p>He might have been pained and depressed hence his 'suicidal rants', but his action was largely needless and incongruent with what the industry should represent today.</p><p>Tiwa Savage is one of Nigeria’s biggest artistes today, she represents some of the biggest corporate brands in the land by virtue of her endorsement deals and she is a mother who is actually attempting a ‘comeback’ after her brief hiatus and with the release of her newest studio album R.E.D. which dropped in late 2015. But everything could become even more complicated for her. We hope not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt61a5o6foggh.jpeg><p>It is sad but the deed has been done, as painful as it is.</p><p>As the world braces up for the eventualities that might follow as a result of the unsavoury details in the rants, and with Tee Billz issuing a fresh statement via a new Twitter account on the fact of&nbsp;his Instagram account being hacked, below are seven lessons we can draw from the situation:</p><p><strong>1. Publicity is bad when it brings out the private lives of couples&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong>In fact, every form of publicity is bad for love and for a healthy relationship. Tee Billz and Tiwa Savage are in the full glare of the public by virtue of their jobs, the least they owe each other is to zip up in matters regarding their private lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt97g4svrjh4o.jpeg><p><strong>2. Silence is golden</strong>&nbsp;– Tiwa Savage did the needful by keeping mum all along, this puts her heads and shoulders above embattled Nollywood actress Toyin Aimakhu and ex-lover Seun Agbede who went back and forth online few months ago when they had issues in their relationship.</p><p><strong>3. The people are tired of the incidence of hacked accounts in Nigeria&nbsp;</strong>– &nbsp;Most Nigerian celebrities and public figures have the habit of twisting the narrative after they've blundered in public using their social media accounts. In the past, people perpetrated evil and blamed it on the devil, today celebrities are entangled in shows of shame and they blame hackers. Please who is deceiving who? There is the need for image consultants and PR experts to be involved in the process of our celebrities and public figure in order for the industry to maximize benefits from this turning point it currently is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7pv4t8qkr62.jpeg><p><strong>4. Tee Billz needs to get another job and leave everything regarding artiste management alone&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;You see, as long as he is in the entertainment circle with his wife Tiwa, whether or not he decides to stop managing her, he will always interface with her and memories (bitter) will will be rekindled.</p><p><strong>5. Nigerian celebrities need to give their lives to Christ</strong>&nbsp;– Stardom is not infinite, in fact life in itself is fleeting. After everything, there'll be the need to look back and ask if one has lived a worthwhile life to be proud of or not. What becomes of mothers whose kids become subjects of ridicule tomorrow as a result of their parents shortcomings? This might sound a bit religious but there's nothing beyond the Almighty. We all need the grace of God to excel. You see, if Tee Billz's allegations in his Instagram rants earlier today, although now deleted, are true then he needs to draw closer to God to help him untie the spiritual chains around him.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>After shocking revelations, will Tee Billz commit suicide? His last post will amaze you</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2ntbs4jhnv1.jpeg><p><strong>6. Nigerian celebrities need psychological checks from time to time&nbsp;</strong>– Suicide is not and will never be the way out but depression is a terrible thing and can drive even the strongest men into an abyss of mental imbalance. Psychologists can help proffer one or two solutions if consulted and Nigerian celebrities need to be oriented on the need to see a doctor or counselor from time to time. Life is beyond wearing shiny necklaces, driving fancy cars and making red carpet appearances. A word is enough for the wise.</p><p><strong>7. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches&nbsp;</strong>– While we wish the couple a 'speedy recovery' from whatever setbacks have put them on the front burner for all the wrong reasons, the current situation shows expressly that no one fully understands a situation enough, regardless of how perfect it looks on the outside, except you are inside or have a personal experience.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXKAkXJnZm5dobK0v86nqmadnqjCqrrGZpurmZ2WerWxxGaZoqScr3q1tdaaZKyZppa0pnrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./crimson-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Crimson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./escapes-hotel-bill.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Guy Tried Skipping Out On His Hotel Bill In The Most Insane Way Imaginable</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
