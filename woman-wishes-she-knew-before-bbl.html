She also said that she wishes she wouldn't have gotten her work done at such a young age, and had someone in her corner who suggested that she wait before getting cut open and modified.</p><p>"Things I wish a BBL girl would have told me before I got my body done!" she writes in a text overlay as she records herself in front of what looks like the locker room mirror at her gym, then sitting in her car.</p><p>The first caveat that she issued to viewers is that after undergoing the procedure, they can expect to "gain weight drastically" when they do gain weight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Plastic surgery (BBL) no one really talks about</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Sufficient-Bug-9112</a> in<a href=#>TikTokCringe</a><span>Source: Reddit | @Sufficient-Bug-9112</span></figure><p>She says that the weight gain occurs tremendously in the area where fat is applied. She added that if you don't work out consistently after getting a BBL, it will become deformed over time where the butt will start to look like "a wisdom tooth ... like more hip and then your legs."</p><p>The TikToker then went on to say that another drawback is that cellulite seems to be more stubborn, which means that if you do get some, it's way more difficult to get rid of, and may necessitate additional surgery from folks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who don't want to rock that dimpled flesh look</a>.</p><p>And then there's the dumpiness that could come with getting a BBL. She states that if folks aren't on the up and up when it comes to maintaining their body, it will inevitably droop: "If you don't maintain your butt, it will start to sag."</p><p>She also said that if you're not very conscientious about your figure, the parts of one's body where fat was extricated from to create the BBL will begin to look a little "warped."</p><p>The cosmetic surgery patient then went on to give an example of what she means: "I don't know if you guys have seen it where when girls gain weight their stomach starts to poke out but they have like the ab sketching and it still like looks weird?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @Sufficient-Bug-9112</span></figure><p>She says that your belly will be big, but that there will still be abs on the front. (So you'll look like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E. Honda in Street Fighter 5</a>.)</p><p>There were different issues with other parts of her body that she wanted to address as well that didn't have anything to do with her BBL, but rather her breast augmentation.</p><p>"I wish they would have told me the importance of under the muscle and over the muscle," she stated before going on that since she had work done on her breasts prior to having children, she wishes she opted for an under-the-muscle look.</p><p>She then stressed to "young girls" that they should wait until their "woman body comes in" before getting any work done on themselves, as the changes their bodies go through may conflict with the slices, nips, tucks, and more that are performed on them when they go under the knife.</p><p>"Once you get it done it's so hard to undo everything," she advises young women. She also said that because "society's beauty standards" are always changing, folks should really consider why they're deciding to get work done on themselves in the first place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @Sufficient-Bug-9112</span><p>"I constantly hear ads for plastic surgery for women who've recently given birth. I think it's called a mommy tuck or something," someone else commented.</p></figure><p>"I wish someone would've told me just wait," she says into the camera after giving a pause upon measuring her words, seemingly out of what appears to be regret for going under the knife.</p><p>She then went on to say that she's giving everyone all of the pros and cons, but went on to say that the "only pros" is that the work is "aesthetically pleasing, right? If you're really, really, really insecure about something I would say yes, fix it, but I wouldn't advise to do it if it's just petite and small, don't do it."</p><p>The more that she discussed plastic surgery, as someone who underwent multiple procedures herself, the instances where she believed it was worth it seemed to shrink and shrink.</p><p>One aspect of cosmetic surgery she said that folks may want to consider is if they, let's say, lost a bunch of weight and then had some excess skin that they wanted to "perk it up" afterwards — she was all for that.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @Sufficient-Bug-9112</span></figure><p>But ultimately, she told "all the girlies" that they should stay away from putting their bodies under the knife as she now has found herself having to "undo everything that [she] once got" when she was 23 years old going on 24, adding that just in a few years (she's 28) she's found herself in a world of regret.</p><p>"Had I just waited and worked out, I would have never touched my body. I would have enjoyed my small breasts, I would have tried to build up my bum a bit more cause I wasn't lacking, I just wanted my hip dips filled. But thing is ... once they start putting fat into it that belongs somewhere else, those fat cells live and when you gain weight everything gains weight," she repeated again toward the end of her clip.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @Sufficient-Bug-9112</span></figure><p>What was especially bad for her, she says, is that she had the procedure done "under COVID time," and that because she stayed in where she was eating and drinking "all the time," she gained a lot of weight in areas she would've rather not gained it.</p><p>Redditors who saw her video seemed to agree with the woman's stance, stating that it seems like more and more people are opting to get elective cosmetic surgeries — especially ones that are expensive and difficult to maintain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mrqKrmJrAbr%2FHnmSkppWseqOxxaipnmWSl7k%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwayne-wade-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dwyane Wade - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sunset-safari-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sunset Safari - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
