Parents are not expected to be psychic. These convictions are about acts that could have halted a runaway train."</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Jennifer Tisdale</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated April 9 2024, 1:48 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In January 2024, the trial of <a href=#>Jennifer Crumbley</a> began nearly three years after she was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter. This particular case was rare in that it was the first time a parent could be held responsible for a school shooting perpetrated by their child. In November 2021, <a href=#>her son Ethan</a> walked into Oxford High School with a gun in his backpack that was gifted to him by his parents. He would go on to shoot 12 people, killing four of them. Those four were fellow students.</p><p>During the trial, it was revealed that Jennifer and her husband James Crumbley were made aware of disturbing drawings done by their son the day of the shooting. The drawings depicted gun violence and threats against his classmates. The school suggested Crumbley be removed and seek counseling, but his parents left him at school. Jennifer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and in March 2024, James followed suit. In April 2024, a judge handed down their sentences.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jennifer and James Crumbley's sentences are lengthy.</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Detroit Free Press</a>, Jennifer and James were each sentenced to 10–15 years in prison. Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews was deeply sympathetic towards the families saying she couldn't possibly imagine what they were feeling. While considering the sentencing, Judge Matthews was careful to point out that Ethan's actions, in all likelihood, could have been avoided if his parents had played a bigger role in their son's life.</p><p>"Parenting is a complex job," said Judge Matthews. "Parents are not expected to be psychic. But these convictions are not about poor parenting. These convictions are (about acts) that could have halted a runaway train." It was James who bought the 9mm handgun his son would later use to kill four students. About that Judge Matthews said, "Mr. Crumbley, it's clear to this court that because of you, there was unfettered access to guns in your home." She also referred to Jennifer's actions as apathetic.</p><p>Jennifer and James are both planning to file appeals. They also requested to get credit for their time served. The judge agreed and credited the two and half years they have already served.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Before sentencing, victim impact statements were read by family members of the victims.</h2><p>Madisyn Baldwin's mother Nicole Beausoleil described her daughter as a kind soul who always had a smile at the ready, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>. She also questioned something Jennifer said during the trial. When asked if she would do anything differently, Jennifer said no. In response to that, Beausoleil compared her time with her daughter to Jennifer's time with Ethan. "While you were purchasing a gun for your son and leaving it unlocked, I was helping her finish her college essay."</p><p>Jill Soave, the mother of Justin Shilling, accused Jennifer and James of not wanting their son and said that was "devastating and heartbreaking." Her son died while protecting another student, which was particularly heart-wrenching for Soave. "You have failed your son, and you have failed us all," she said to the Crumbleys.</p><p>While wearing a sweatshirt featuring a picture of his son Justin, Craig Shilling echoed what Judge Matthews said. "I just can't get over the fact that this tragedy was completely avoidable," he told the court. He also said that everyday he lives with "pain, anger, heartache, regret, anxiety, stress, you name it. They're all there wreaking havoc in my once normal life."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"Our 10-year-old little brother had to learn how to write a eulogy for his sister before he even learned how to write essays," said Reina St. Juliana. She saw her sister Hana in the hallway that day and was crushed by the fact that she didn't get to say goodbye to her. They were best friends and were so close that Reina was looking forward to being by her side for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Hana's father Steve said her death "destroyed a large portion of my very soul." He mourned the loss of a future she never got to have, one that included graduation ceremonies, marriage, and the joy of possibly starting her own family. Each family member who spoke requested that Jennifer and James receive the maximum sentence, which they did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusifnKtlk6fCrq7LnrBmq5Wjwaa6wqKloA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./myla-dalbesio-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Myla Dalbesio - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./baby-geniuses-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Baby Geniuses - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
