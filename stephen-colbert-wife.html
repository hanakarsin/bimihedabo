Whether it be through his work on The Colbert Report, frequent major award wins, or even his 2008 presidential bid, Stephen has engrained himself into today's comedic landscape like no other. Now, he's pivoting to another fun and hilarious gig: hosting Pickled, a new celebrity pickleball game show.</p><p>For all of those reasons and more, legions of fans worldwide are familiar with Stephen's unique brand of comedy. However, not as many fans may be aware of the circumstances surrounding his personal life. With that being said, who is Stephen's wife? Does he have any kids? Keep reading to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is Stephen Colbert's wife?</h2><p>Stephen has been married to Evelyn "Evie" McGee Colbert for more than 20 years now, and the couple has been happily in love during that entire time.</p><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, Evelyn was born on July 23, 1963, in Charleston, S.C. She is a graduate of the University of Virginia, where she earned her degree with a double major in English and drama. After that, she also graduated from New York City's Circle in the Square Theater School.</p><p>Stephen has been candid about how he and Evelyn met one another in the past. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> the entire story to his fans on live television once, and it's nothing but heartwarming.</p><p>He said that he had been dating another woman at the time who gave him an ultimatum: marriage or breakup. Stephen returned home to Charleston, S.C. to clear his mind. When his mother asked if he was ready to marry the woman, he wasn't sure, to which she replied “'I don’t know' isn’t good enough."</p><p>So, Stephen decided she was right and attended a play premiere that night with her to clear his mind. While there, he spotted a woman in a black linen dress and thought, "Her. Honest to God I thought, there’s your wife, you’re going to marry her." After the show, they finally interacted and it turned out that they had mutual friends and both grew up there, but just went to different schools. They started dating after that and the rest was history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Evelyn, a talented actress in her own right, has a filmography that includes roles on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, In the Saddle, Alpha House, and Nuptials. Currently, Evelyn works as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a member of the Montclair Film Board of Trustees</a>, where she serves as its president. The organization is based in Montclair, N.J., where her family calls home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Does Stephen Colbert have any kids?</h2><p>When you're one of 11 children, it makes sense that you'd probably want to set up a family of your own someday too, and that's exactly what Stephen has done. His loving marriage to Evelyn has birthed three children: Madeline, their daughter who was born in 1995, Peter, their son who was born in 1998, and John, their son who was born in 2002.</p><p>Just like the terms by which his marriage came to be, Stephen has been very candid about what being a parent means to him. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a>, he said, "I didn't know what to expect, but I think the most surprising thing is that, while it's hard — it's hard — but even the hard parts are just beautiful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmvMeepWabn6Gvpr7TZq6inpU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beau-is-afraid-ending-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Beau Make It Home?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./south-africa-stun-italy-to-join-nigeria-in-2023-world-cup-quarter-finals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>South Africa Stun Italy To Join Nigeria In 2023 World Cup Quarter-Finals</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
