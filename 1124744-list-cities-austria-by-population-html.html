From the first minute, it amazes with its charm, grandeur, beauty, a wonderful combination of ancient castles and modern skyscrapers, high art and youth subcultures. Since ancient times, the city has won its fame as the musical capital. Here Strauss, Schubert, Mozart, Schoenberg and Beethoven wrote their legendary overtures and symphonies. Today, their music sounds can be heard at the famous Vienna Opera Ball. To receive a free invitation to this place is considered a great honour for any dancer.

It is the capital of the federal state of Styria and happens to be a large student center: there are several universities here with over 55,000 students - that is about 20% of the population. Also Graz is famous for its lively cultural life: the city regularly hosts festivals, exhibitions, fairs and colourful national holidays, attracting a huge number of tourists and participants. In 2003 , Graz was recognized as the cultural capital of Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytcag0g50tock.jpg><p class=align-left>Many cultural traditions are rooted in the past, as there have been a lot of bright moments in the history of the city. Graz was the residence of the Habsburgs, the capital of Inner Austria, the center of Protestantism, an important European outpost during the Turkish raids in the 16th century, and also part of the Napoleonic Empire, the fascist German republic and the British occupation zone. In THE local universities, Nikola Tesla and Erwin Schrodinger received their education, and the village of Tal, 4 km from Graz, became famous for being THE birthplace of Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/31c1324abb4bcdd6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most beautiful house in the world: Top 10 gorgeous homes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is interesting that in Austria, Graz is considered to be the most "Italian" city: here you can see magnificent palaces, elegant mansions decorated with frescoes, and cozy Venetian courtyards. The thing is that during the Baroque era, talented Italians worked on the architectural image of the city: Domenico Del Allio, who built the palace complex Landhouse in the spirit of the Florentine palazzo, Giovanni Pietro de Pomis, the author of the mausoleum of Ferdinand II, and others.</p><h3>3. Linz</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1n1crcklfj48.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>Continent: </strong>Europe</p><p class=align-left><strong>Land: </strong>Upper Austria</p><p class=align-left><strong>Population: </strong>200,841 people</p><p class=align-left>Linz is the administrative center of Upper Austria, the third largest city in the country and a large industrial and transport center.</p><p class=align-left>It is located at the confluence of the Traun River in the Danube. The city was founded by the Romans as the port of Lentia and quickly turned into the main medieval center of commerce on this great river. From 1489 to 1493, it even managed to become the capital of the empire. In 1785, the city became the center of the bishopric, but as the stronghold of Protestantism was heavily destroyed by the Bavarians, Linz left the political arena of the country for many years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dfe7f553c41ea654.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>22 cities in Belgium to visit in 2024: explore the country's best attractions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Only in the 19th century did the favorable position of Linz began to be profitable again - in 1832 the first horse-drawn railway on the continent passed here, and by the end of the century, the city developed into the largest railway junction of the empire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4aunlacqm1p.jpg><p class=align-left>But today, the main street of Linz Landstrasse may seem surprisingly deserted. There are no more cars, but trams, shops, cafes and department stores give it a peculiar look. The historic area of Altstadt at the northern end of the Landstrasse is quite small.</p><p class=align-left>Only fragments of old city walls may be found. For example, a beautiful main square Hauptplatz (the largest medieval square in the country) with a column of the Holy Trinity (XVIII century) and the Old Town Hall (XVI century), the main art gallery of the city - Lentos Kunstmuseum (one of the largest museums of modern art in Austria) near the Nibelungenbrücke bridge, the Alter Dom cathedral (the 17th century) in the southeastern corner of Hauptplatz, the parish church with the mausoleum of Emperor Frederick III, as well as the regional parliament complex in the former Minorite monastery (XIII-XV cc.).</p><p class=align-left>At the western extremity of Altstadt, on a high cliff above the Danube, there is Weinberg Castle (13th-15th centuries), formerly the residence of Frederick III and now - the Land Museum of Upper Austria.</p><h3>4. Salzburg</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/31c1324abb4bcdd6.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>Continent: </strong>Europe</p><p class=align-left><strong>Land: </strong>Salzburg Population: 150,887 people</p><p class=align-left>Salzburg is in the west of the country. It is the fourth largest city in Austria. Salzburg means ‘Salt Castle’, because once upon a time, people transported salt on barges on its river. Salzburg is famous as the birth place of the great composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Also the famous film ‘Sounds of Music’ was shot here. In addition, the historical Baroque architecture is preserved in this city. Salzburg is called the city of three universities, where a large number of students live and study.</p><p class=align-left>In Salzburg, the Old Town is under the protection of UNESCO, because it was built in the style of Baroque architecture. The central square of Residenzplatz, which has retained its appearance from the 18th century, is worth your visit for sure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt67gn3stefra.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Easiest country to migrate to from Nigeria: Top 5</p><p class=align-left>You can find the ‘Archbishop's Residence’ dating back to the 17th century. There are 35 bells and ancient clock towers. The fountain Residenzbrunnen, which was built in 1661, is particularly attractive. The famous historical attraction is the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter, which was founded by Saint Rupert. At first, the cathedral was built in the Romanesque style, then it was rebuilt in the baroque style. The cathedral keeps the relics of Saint Rupert.</p><h3>5. Innsbruck</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dfe7f553c41ea654.png><p class=align-left><strong>Continent: </strong>Europe</p><p class=align-left><strong>Land: </strong>Tyrol</p><p class=align-left><strong>Population: </strong>130 894 people</p><p class=align-left>Innsbruck is the capital of the land of Tyrol with a population of about 130,000 people. The name of the city of Innsbruck in German means "bridge over the Inn River". This is one of the most beautiful cities of the Old World and, perhaps, the only European city that successfully combines sporting and urban lifestyle. In 1964 and in 1976, the Winter Olympic Games were held here. Since then, the city became the center for winter sports with modern infrastructure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5n2ohj1ulfg.jpg><p class=align-left>The main sights of the city are located in the Old Town on the right bank of the Inn.
