Here’s a breakdown of Billy Ray and Tish’s relationship, including all the highs and lows they've faced together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The early '90s</h2><p>Billy Ray and Tish met in 1991, not long after his divorce from his first wife, Cindy Smith, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>Their first child together — daughter Destiny Hope, later known as <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> — was welcomed into the world in late 1992. (The pair also had children from previous relationships; Tish had daughter Brandi in 1987 and son Trace in 1989, while Billy Ray had a son named Christopher born in early 1992 — the same year as Miley — from a previous relationship.)</p><p>In 1993, Billy Ray and Tish officially tied the knot in a Tennessee wedding ceremony.</p><p>In 1994, they welcomed their son Braison into the world.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Miley and younger sister Noah in 2010</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The early 2000s</h2><p>In 2000, Billy Ray and Tish had their youngest daughter, <a href=#>Noah Cyrus</a>.

Two years after their first reconciliation, Tish filed for divorce. She also cited irreconcilable differences. Later on in 2013, they made the announcement that they would be attending couples therapy together to continue working things out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The most recent update and divorce announcement in 2022</h2><p>In April 2022, Tish filed for divorce again, citing irreconcilable differences. She reportedly also filed a restraining order in order to protect their marital property. Because of this action, she prevents her estranged husband from easily transferring or concealing any of their joint assets.</p><p>It also blocks him from being able to harass her or make disparaging comments in front of their family members. Billy Ray and Tish released a joint statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> saying, “It is after 30 years, five amazing children and a lifetime of memories, we have decided to go our separate ways — not with sadness, but with love in our hearts."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>They continued, "We have grown up together, raised a family we can be so proud of, and it is now time to create our own paths. We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents. We have not come to this decision lightly or quickly but with so much going on in the world, we wanted to provide some clarity and closure, so we can remain focused on what is important. With Love and Hope … Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus."</p><p>Since this is the third time Billy Ray and Tish have attempted to get divorced, it’s unclear just how serious they are about truly following through with their plans this time. Only time will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7atuNhmqZqxXZjGs8HSZquiq5hiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedOipJ6kmaOy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cloecouture-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CloeCouture - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-i-want-to-become-buharis-successor-al-mustapha.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why I Want To Become Buharis Successor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
