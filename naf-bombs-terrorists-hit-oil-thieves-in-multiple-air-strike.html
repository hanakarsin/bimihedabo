style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Nigerian Air Force <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>(NAF)</a></strong> has neutralized some terrorists in recent air strikes in the North-Eastern region of the country.</p><p>This is as the NAF also bombarded some oil thieves in the Niger Delta region in recent operations.</p><p>In a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Sunday (today), the Director of Public Relations and Information, NAF, Air Commodore<strong> Edward Gabkwet</strong>, said the operations were carried out by the air component of Operation Delta Safe (OPDS) and Operation Hadin Kai.</p><p>According to him, the recent success of the airforce was in the continuation of efforts aimed at containing the activities of terrorists, militants and other criminal elements bent on destabilising the nation and making life unbearable to peace-loving Nigerians.</p><p>He said the air component of OPDS had, on August 27, carried out air interdiction missions on some illegal refining sites located at Cawthorne Channels, Bille and Gogokori in Degema Local Government Area of Rivers.</p><p>He said that a Cotonou boat observed to be loaded with illegal refined products and heading into open waters was also engaged and destroyed at Gogokori.</p><p>According to him, similar strikes were also extended to Idama in the Akuku‐Toru Local Government Area and Omoma in the Degema Local Government Area of Rivers upon receipt of intelligence of refining activities at the two locations.</p><p>Gabkwet said that overhead both locations, active illegal refining sites with reservoirs suspected to contain illegally refined products were sighted, adding that the reservoirs were subsequently engaged, destroyed and engulfed in flames.</p><p>He said that militants/pirates’ camps identified as Big Joe’s Camp, Sunny’s Camp, Davids’ Camp in Bakassi Local Government Area and Amos Camps in Calabar South Local Government Area in Cross River were on Aug. 25, attacked by the air component of OPDS.</p><p>Gabkwet explained further that the air strikes were authorised after confirming the locations to be littered with these criminals and their activities.</p><p>“Those that attempted to escape through their various escape routes were also attacked.</p><p>“In one of the suspected kidnappers’ camps, a lone structure suspected to be harbouring some kidnapped victims with armed men roaming around the structure was also attacked using guns on board the aircraft.</p><p>“The strikes led to pandemonium with several kidnapped victims seen escaping,” he said.</p><p>Speaking on the air strike in the Northeastern part of the country, the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>NAF</a></strong> spokesman said that strikes were conducted on Aug. 25 at Chinene, a persistent terrorists’ hideout in Mandara mountains, which had been struck on several occasions in the past.</p><p>He said the location was struck with several terrorists neutralised, having observed that the area had continually hosted gatherings of terrorists and their activities, adding that others fled for their lives.</p><p>Gabkwet noted further that the NAF aircraft have continued to give the requisite outcome while denying non-state actors the freedom to perpetrate their nefarious acts at will.</p><p>“While the NAF, alongside other security agencies, remain focused in undertaking their assigned tasks, the need for all Nigerians to see themselves as part of the solution to these challenges through the provision of actionable information to security agencies cannot be overemphasised,” he urged.</p><p class=postsid
