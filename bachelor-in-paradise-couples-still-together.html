Jade Roper Tolbert and Tanner Tolbert</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Tanner and Jade are often the two that come to mind when Bachelor in Paradise fans think of the duos who are still happily together — and their love story rivals the ones featured on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.</p><p>The two met on the second season in 2015, and they became a couple almost immediately. Jade and Tanner wed in front of the cameras in January 2016, and they have gone on to have three kids together: Emerson (Emmy), Brooks, and Reed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Raven Gates Gottschalk and Adam Gottschalk</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The pair got together on Season 4 of the ABC reality series in 2017, and Adam made the decision not to propose to Raven during the finale. They continued to date after the show, and they got engaged in the summer of 2019.</p><p>Like many other couples, Raven and Adam intended on getting married in 2020, but their plans were derailed because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They delayed their nuptials a few times before they were able to wed in April 2021.</p><p>About three months after their wedding, the newlyweds announced that they are expecting their first child together. Their baby is due in January 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Astrid Loch and Kevin Wendt</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Astrid and The Bachelorette Canada Season 1 winner got together on Season 5 of Bachelor in Paradise. Though the couple broke up on the show, they announced that they had reconciled their relationship on the reunion.</p><p>Kevin and Astrid got engaged in the summer of 2019. Their first child is due in November 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Caelynn Miller-Keyes and Dean Unglert</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Caelynn Miller-Keyes (@caelynnmillerkeyes)</a></p></figure><p>Dean is no stranger to appearing on Bachelor Nation shows, but he finally found a lasting bond with Caelynn during his second go-round on BiP. He actually left Caelynn and Season 6 behind (on her birthday, no less) a few weeks in, but he later briefly returned to give their relationship another shot.</p><p>Since then, Dean and Caelynn have traveled the world together — and she has even spent time living in his infamous van. The two bought a house in Nevada together in 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Hannah Godwin and Dylan Barbour</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Though one of the most dramatic storylines at the beginning of Season 6 was the love triangle between Hannah, Dylan, and Blake Horstmann, it was quickly resolved when the Alabama native chose to pursue a relationship with the Vizer co-founder.</p><p>Dylan was one of three to propose during the finale episode, but his engagement is the only one that has lasted.</p><p>Hannah and Dylan often share goofy moments in their romance on social media, and they live in San Diego together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Ashley Iaconetti Haibon and Jared Haibon</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jared and Ashley didn't exactly have an easy road to love on Bachelor in Paradise, and many tears were shed in the process. While Ashley was convinced that Jared was the one as soon as she laid eyes on him, their romance fizzled out. The following season, he later rejected her in favor of getting to know Caila Quinn.</p><p>Long after their time on the show concluded, Ashley and Jared shocked fans when they announced in a vlog that they were in a relationship. Jared proposed at the beach where the two met, on Season 5 of the show.</p><p>About two years after their nuptials, the couple shared that they were expecting their first child together.</p><p>Will any of the duos on Season 7 join this list? Only time will tell.</p><p>Bachelor in Paradise airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66ktMSlpqtlmaN6sa3Rmpuiq5VisLDBz6WcrGWjqbatuIytpqCdpJ2ysw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./valerie-bertinelli-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Valerie Bertinelli - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leo-barstarzz-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leo Barstarzz - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
