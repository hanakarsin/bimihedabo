class=wp-caption-text>Governor Sanwo-Olu receives report from Judicial panel</p><p>The Lagos state Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and other matters had stated that the killing of peaceful protesters at Lekki toll gate on the night of October 20, 2020, <a href=# rel=noopener>can be equated to a ‘massacre’.</a></p><p>Naija News reports that the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel disclosed this in its report submitted to the Lagos State Government on Monday.</p><p>The report was titled, ‘Report Of Lekki Incident Investigation Of 20th October 2020’.</p><p>According to the panel, at least 48 protesters were either shot dead, injured with bullets wounds or assaulted by soldiers who stormed the Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020.</p><p>It partly read, “The atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a ‘massacre’ in context.”</p><p>“It was alleged and corroborated that the soldiers had their vans parked at the Lekki Toll Gate and removed as many bodies and corpses of the fallen protesters which they took away with their vans,” it added on page 295.</p><p>The panel in its report <a href=# rel=noopener>indicted Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in</a> the shooting and killing of protesters at Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020.</p><p>The panel said the state government through the governor invited the Nigerian Army to the state.</p><p>The panel added that following the state government invitation, the Army deployed its soldiers to the Lekki toll gate on the night of October 20, 2020.</p><p>It partly reads: “The panel found that there was an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State made by the Lagos State Government through the Governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th of October.”</p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><p>The panel asked the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led government to <a href=# rel=noopener>rename the Lekki Tollgate.</a></p><p>It also stated, “The Panel recommends that the Lekki Toll Plaza be made a memorial site for ENDSARS Protest: By renaming to ‘ENDSARS TOLLGATE’.</p><p>“The panel recommends that October 20th of every year, the day is made a ‘Toll Free Day’ at the Lekki Toll Gate as long as the tollgate exists.</p><p>“That for the purpose of restitution, healing and reconciliation, the federal government needs to publicly apologize to the youth for abruptly undermining the protest with their state actors.</p><p>“The government should do all it can to bridge the gap of distrust with the Youth.</p><p>“A monument memorializing the lives lost and those injured at the Lekki Toll Gate with the names inscribed on the Monument.”</p><p><strong>Reactions</strong></p><p>Reacting to the outcome of the panel, Shehu Sani in a post on his Twitter account, said those that have been in denial of the Lekki massacre can <a href=# rel=noopener>now bury their shame</a>.</p><p>He said they should accept the fact that they tried all possible means to cover up the truth of the incidents.</p><p>On his part, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor declared that the right thing to do is to <a href=# rel=noopener>wait for the white paper</a> report on the Lagos Judicial Panel report before taking any position on the reported Lekki Toll Gate killing of protesters by soldiers.</p><p>The CDS added that it is wrong to assume what is coming from social media about the panel report is the absolute truth.</p><h2>Nnamdi Kanu’s DSS detention</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-443944

Kanu.</a></p><p>IPOB, in a statement on Friday issued by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, alleged that it has uncovered the sinister plot to kill its leader through intelligence.</p><p>Powerful claimed that the Nigerian government has concluded plans to assassinate its leader and declare a state of emergency in the South-East.</p><p>He claimed that the Nigerian government was not comfortable with the international attention that Kanu’s rendition has received and the fate that await her at the International Criminal Court ICC, hence its contemplation of killing Kanu.</p><p>Reacting, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ohanaeze Ndigbo</a>, warned against any planned attempt to assassinate Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p>Stating that Igbo leaders are the cause of ruse in the Southeastern region of the country, the group said the federal government wouldn’t dare to assassinate Kanu for the fear of consequences that will follow.</p><p>In a statement issued through its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Ohanaeze said President Muhammadu Buhari is aware of the consequences of hurting a British citizen in their custody, and would not dare attempt to hurt Kanu who is in their custody.</p><h2>Psquare reunite after five years</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Psquare-and-Jude.jpg alt
