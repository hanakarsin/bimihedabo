I am aware that our leaders are not sleeping over it. They are still talking to Prince Dotun Babayemi and others in the party, not minding our victory at the polls. We are always better together. We are not taking anyone for granted.</p><p class=p2>“We believe everyone should come on board now so we can have a seamless administration; so that we can deliver our promises to the good people of Osun State. You know we cannot do that on the platform of rancourous relationship as a political party.</p><p class=p1>“Dotun Babayemi is a prince and I’m sure that the blue blood in him will speak to his veins. We need a bit of fresh air which the good people of Osun State have put in place via the verdict during the gubernatorial election.</p><p class=p1>“We are still trying to talk to him and manage the situation. Differences cannot help anyone. We have seen the worst of what internal rancour can do to a political party. We won’t do anything that will leave us open to some other forces trying to creep in.”</p><p class=p1>Meanwhile, the Director General Adeleke Campaign Organisation, Sunday Bisi, in another interview debunked the existence of a factional governorship candidate in the party.</p><p>He noted that the Independent National Electoral Commission published the names of candidates of every political party and they didn’t have two governorship candidates.</p><p>Bisi said that it would be wrong and unlawful of anyone to say someone is factional, adding that Adeleke is their only candidate.</p><p class=p1>He said: “We do not have any factional candidates. INEC had published the names of candidates of every political party. There was nowhere in the publication that we had two governorship candidates.</p><p class=p1>“So, it will be wrong and unlawful of you to say someone is factional; we do not have it again. There is one candidate and that is Ademola Adeleke. The party is one indivisible element. We do not have a faction in the PDP. For now, I know that PDP is one. And if anybody has approached any law court, let the court decide.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5ByZqirpaN6tb7OrpmlnV2bvLN5wJ2cpZ2bmnqiv4ylmLCrpZ7Bbq%2FHmqOlnZ6ctq%2BzjKmbqWWgp7aurdGyZKaZqWK1or7MZp6umpWnere1wq2mq7Ff</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-bj-klock-become-famous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is BJ Klock and How Did He Become So Famous?
