White fasting, also known as Daniel fast, is Christian fasting that gets its inspiration from Daniel chapter 10 verses 2-3 and Daniel chapter 1 verse 8. Prophet Daniel did not eat 'pleasant bread, flesh or wine' for three weeks in said verses. In his words, he did not want to defile himself with King's food while he was mourning.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike many other fasts, this one is not tethered to any particular<a href=#> religious holiday</a>. Instead, you can choose to go on white fast whenever you feel like it.</p><h2>What to eat during white fasting</h2><p class=align-left>Wondering about what to eat while fasting for god?
