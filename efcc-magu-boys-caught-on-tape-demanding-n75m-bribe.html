Abaza to lift the restrictions on the account of Damijay Services Limited, after the firm had filed a suit for fundamental rights enforcement at the FCT High Court.</p><p>An Abuja-based lawyer, Barrister Victor Giwa who was allegedly involved in the deal, the Economic confidential gathered did not deny his voice in the 27 minutes tape recording that was played before the panel where he mentioned names of suspended Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu among other operatives over the bribery allegation.</p><p>Barrister Giwa was the former lawyer to the company on the case with the EFCC.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the affidavit sighted by the Economic Confidential, the businessman alleged that on or around 20th of May, 2020 Barrister Victor Giwa asked him to sign three blank cheques (valued at 25 million Naira each), which he would hand over to the people in EFCC to enable them to unfreeze the account.</p><p>The petitioner had revealed that the said “Magu boys”, had sent three different bank accounts namely Cikin Gida Nigeria Limited with account number: 1771773211, at Polaris Bank; Black and Black Global Concept Limited with account number: 0259011841 with Gtbank and Amina Kigbu with account number: 2176716071 with Zenith Bank for the payment of the alleged bribe.</p><p>When the cheques were not honoured by the bank, the Magu boys requested that the businessman should execute an Irrevocable Standing Payment Order (on the company’s official letterhead) in favour of the three bank accounts and later demanded 40% of the money in the company’s account (which aggregates to One Hundred Million Naira) which the businessman outrightly rejected.</p><p>After rejecting their last demand, the businessman said that: “On the 9th of July, 2020, Mr Mohammed Goje of EFCC called me to come to their office the next day being 10th July, 2020 (Friday). I honoured the invitation and stayed for long hours only for me to be informed by him (around 5: 09 pm after I had left) that I have been charged to Court by SMS and that I was to appear before the F.C.T. High Cout sitting at Lugbe by 8:30 am on Monday, 13th July 2020 to be with a copy of the charge and arraigned simultaneously.</p><p>“He warned me via the SMS to ‘endeavour to come to avoid unnecessary embarrassment.’ On the 13th of July, 2020 while at the Lugbe High Court, I was served with an Amended Charge dated and filed on the 19th day of June, 2020 (exactly 2 days after I outrightly rejected their fresh demand of 40% of the total sum of the money in the company’s account).</p><p>“The said amended charge was signed by one ABBA MUHAMMED of Legal and Prosecution Department of the EFCC with Supreme Court No: (SCN046977). Upon going through the documents served on me in Court, I discovered to my chagrin that there is an earlier charge dated the 3rd day of January 2019 and filed on the 4th day of January 2019 signed by one AISHA A. T. HABIB from the Legal & Prosecution Department of the EFCC with Supreme Court No: SCN014045. This particular charged of 4th January 2019 (which is over a year and five months) was never served on me.”</p><p>It went on to add that: “After presenting the petition to the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation and specifically on Monday, the 6th day of August 2020, I called Barrister VICTOR GIWA and informed him that a copy of the correspondences he has been exchanging with the operatives of the EFCC would be needed at the office of the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation in support of the petition.</p><p>“In response to my request as per the preceding paragraph, Barrister VICTOR GIWA told me over the phone that he has been receiving calls from agents of the EFCC and that in particular one AISHA of the EFCC was crying and pleading with him not to expose them else her career would be ruined.</p><p>“He (Barrister VICTOR GIWA) further said that some other EFCC officials, which he has been corresponding with, called him to query him on why he allowed me to write the petition to the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation and demanded that the said petition (Exhibit Dami 1) be withdrawn else there would be consequences after the storm currently buffeting the Commission.</p><p>“Barrister VICTOR GIWA further told me that those EFCC officials reminded him that he is a young Lawyer and that he has a lot before him and that he should not forget that what is happening at the EFCC at the time was a tussle between the Honourable AGF and the suspended Acting Chairman of the EFCC and boasted that things would soon return to normal at the EFCC. They thereafter asked him to call me so we could have a meeting where the matter would be effectively resolved.</p><p>“On 7th August 2020, I instructed Barrister Johnmary Jideobi to call Barrister Victor and remind him of the request I made on him the previous night. Barrister VICTOR GIWA told Barrister Johnmary Jideobi that he was not going to make the correspondences yet available to me because he had those discussions with the EFCC people in confidence and that we should not join the fray of what was/is happening because no one knows tomorrow. That he would not want to offend the people who gave him the information in confidence since he should be honourable enough not to do things that would offend them. Barrister VICTOR GIWA later told Barrister Johnmary Jideobi that he would call him back and hung up but never did that day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5ByZp6ek5h6rq3GrmSbp6moeqSt1KCfrWWfo3q1rc%2BeZJ2dnZa7pbXNoGSnb2WieqO%2ByJucaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hudu-yunusa-ari.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Hudu Yunusa-Ari On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylian-mbappes-younger-brother-ethan-makes-his-psg-debut.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kylian Mbappe's Younger Brother, Ethan Makes His PSG Debut</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
