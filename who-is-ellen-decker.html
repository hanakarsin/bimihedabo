She’s currently signed with Caroline Gleason Management and boasts an impressive Instagram following (over 36k).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>But what we find most interesting about Ellen is her job as a high school mathematics and science teacher. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> reveals that she’s worked for Score At The Top Learning Centers & Schools since September 2017.</p><p>Under experience, Ellen writes that as an instructor, she "diagnosed readiness, assessed prior and current knowledge, and delivered material through [a] variety of self-created and technology integrated resources."</p><p>During her time as an undergrad at Southern New Hampshire University, where she received a degree in Middle School Math Education, Ellen played on the women’s lacrosse team.&nbsp;</p><p>After finding out that Jed was "vacationing" with a new woman, Bachelorette fans gave the musician a hard time on social media due to the controversy surrounding his past romances.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The singer’s engagement to Hannah ended after his ex-girlfriend, Haley Stevens, publicly stated that the duo was still dating when Jed left to film The Bachelorette. She also claimed that he had told her he loved her on a trip to the Bahamas after he had already been cast on the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jed Wyatt previously said he’s too busy for dating.</h2><p>Ellen may find herself ghosted if Jed’s recent comments about his personal life are to be believed. In a September interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, the reality star shared, "I’m not necessarily looking [for love]. I’m just praying that things fall into place as they should."</p><p>Jed told the publication that he’s focusing on himself at the moment. "I’ve been really working hard with one of my friends. I haven’t said much about it, but we’re working on a non-profit charity," he explained. "That’s been, honestly, more than music lately… I can’t really think about a relationship right now."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The Nashville-based songwriter added that it was difficult for him to get back into a normal routine after the drama-filled Bachelorette finale. "My head was just so out of everything. The only thing that I really felt like doing was, like, being alone or journaling or going fishing," he admitted.&nbsp;</p><p>"For some reason, I couldn’t get the pen to paper to write or be creative like that. It was just such a low spot," he continued. "I’d sit down and try to write, try to play and my head wasn’t in it."</p><p>Jed officially returned to the stage for iHeart Radio’s SoCal Country at the Brewery event last month in Irwindale, Calif. We really hope he played his "Mr. Right" ditty for the crowd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ6knJq7brDEnKKeqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1111986-annie-idibia-biography-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Annie Idibia biography: age, husband, children, career, net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-terrorists-release-23-passengers-of-kaduna-train-attack.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Terrorists Release 23 Passengers Of Kaduna Train Attack</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
