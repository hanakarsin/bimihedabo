It seems like at least once a week, a totally new test is trending on the platform that's focused on determining whether you're a <a href=#>soldier, poet, or king</a>, or <a href=#>what your weakness might be</a>.</p><p>Recently, though, TikTok has been obsessed with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnie the Pooh pathology test</a>, which comes from IDR Labs. Here's what we know about the pathology test and why it's going viral on TikTok.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Winnie the Pooh pathology test?</h2><p>The latest test that has become the focus of so much attention on Twitter is a Winnie the Pooh pathology test. The test claims that every major character in the Hundred Acre Wood could be associated with a mental health condition.</p><p>â€œProfessors Dr. Sarah E. Shea (M.D.), Dr. Kevin Gordon (M.D.), and associates studied the characters of Winnie the Pooh and concluded that each of them could be linked to a definite psychiatric diagnosis," the site hosting the test explains.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Of course, this doesn't mean that taking the test is the equivalent of a diagnosis, or that it should be substituted for professional consultation or care. When you ultimately take the test, though, you will be shown how much your personality can be associated with each character from Winnie the Pooh, and the psychiatric condition that they are associated with.</p><p>Tigger, for example, is associated with ADHD, while Rabbit is associated with OCD. The results from the quiz will appear as a chart that shows how strongly you are related to each character, and users have been sharing those results all over TikTok, even though they also suggest which psychiatric condition a person is most likely to have.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to take the Winnie the Pooh test yourself.</h2><p>If you're curious about what your results would be, actually taking the test is relatively straightforward. Here's what you should do:</p><li>Go to the Pooh pathology test <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">available at this link</a>.</li><li>The quiz contains 33 question, and all you need to do to start the quiz is scroll down to the first one and adjust the slider based on the prompt you're given.</li><li>Once you've finished the quiz, you'll be given the chart referenced above as well as a description of the character you most closely resemble.</li><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@r1verphoen1x href=#>@r1verphoen1x</a><p>i mean its what i would expect but i dont think i have schizophrenia <a title=winniethepoohtest href=#>#winniethepoohtest</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=anxiety href=#>#anxiety</a> <a title=piglet href=#>#piglet</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - speediousðŸ’—" href=#>â™¬ original sound - speediousðŸ’—</a></figure><p>Once you have the results, they're yours to do with as you like. If you want to share them on TikTok as so many others are doing, all you need to do is screenshot them and post a video about it. If, after you see the results, you realize that they hit a little too close to home and you'd like to keep them to yourself, you can do that too.</p><p>Personality quizzes can be totally meaningless, and they don't necessarily mean anything about who you really are. If you do find that it resonates with you, it could be a total coincidence or it could mean that the quiz is pretty good. Ultimately, though, you should think of them as a fun distraction and not as something that should transform how you think about yourself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLavusieZK2glWK9sLvHZqueq6Riwaq306ii</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-ondo-governor-rotimi-akeredolu-reportedly-dies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu Is Dead</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bering-sea-gold-emily-riedel-filming-covid-19.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>'Bering Sea Gold' Star Emily Riedel Talks Filming During COVID-19 (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
