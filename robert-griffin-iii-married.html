Sources told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> that the surprising move was made for financial reasons and that Robert <a href=#>wasn't the only one</a> who was laid off from his high-profile job with the company.</p><p>In response to being let go, Robert took to X to find some humor in the situation, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing a clip</a> from the movie Friday in which John Witherspoon’s character asks, “How the hell you going to get fired on your day off?” To his tweet, his wife, Grete Griffin, responded supportively: "Onto bigger and better things."</p><p>Now, fans want to know more about his wife and family outside of sports.

Robert and Grete got engaged in 2017 and married on March 10, 2018. The couple has been going strong since then, often sharing adorable snaps on social media.</p><p>In fact, a photo of the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eating a giant croissant</a>, recently posted by Grete on Instagram, turned into a full-fledged internet meme.</p><p>Aside from being a WAG, Grete has her own athletic background. She's actually a heptathlete from Estonia who attended Florida State University on a full athletic scholarship. She's also an entrepreneur who owns Glow Fitness, a health and beauty brand "aimed at helping you lose weight and gain the results you’re looking for with workouts for at home or the gym," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her LinkedIn bio</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Grete Griffin (@gretegiii)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Robert Griffin III have any kids?</h2><p>Robert Griffin III has four daughters: one from his first marriage to Rebecca Liddicoat and three from his current relationship with Grete Griffin. His oldest daughter, Reese Ann, was born in 2015, one year before dad Robert and mom Rebecca filed for divorce. His second daughter (and first with Grete) Gloria, was born in 2017, the year before Robert and Grete were married.</p><p>Gameya, the couple's second daughter and Robert's third, was born in 2019. His fourth daughter was born on New Year's Even in 2022, which fans may remember as he had to rush away from Pat McAfee's Fiesta Bowl Broadcast after learning that Grete had gone into labor.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Robert told the outlet that being a "girl dad" to four changed his life: "Honestly, it just changes your perspective on life. No matter whatever's happened with me on camera, off camera, when I come home, I'm Daddy. And they run up to Daddy and they give Daddy a hug, and it takes all your worries away."</p><p>"They got an amazing mother here in my wife, Grete," he said, "who really makes a lot of sacrifices for me to be able to do the job that I'm doing. But she always makes it to where I'm present for my kids and I want to be present for them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjsdGtZKCqmZuzqrqMoqCiZZ2Wv7O1xJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pawn-stars-cast-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Kind of Net Worth Does the Cast of 'Pawn Stars' Have?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-mescal-sister.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Mescal's Sister Details on His Sibling's Music Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
