So, you don’t even know who the delegates are … and this happened in several states.</p><p>“Even where people are selected, they should be given the freedom to exercise their franchise by voting for who they want, but it was not like that. The governors selected those to whom they would give instructions and some of them took an oath to vote where the governors direct them and this was what happened in Kwara State.</p><p>“In my election (primary), 17 delegates came back to give me money which I gave them for logistics; others did not because they said ‘we wanted to vote for you, but we are not allowed to vote. There was one of my colleagues in Kogi who mentioned that people came back (to return his money).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FyZmpvXZmyrbHGmqueq12nsqfBzZ2cnWWdpLumxYyiZKCZppp6tbTEpmSaqJNiwKa6wK2mq2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-ripple-in-time-pokemon-go-rewards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All Rewards in A Ripple in Time Special Research Pokmon GO</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heartstopper-season-2-cast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Heartstopper' Season 2 Teases New Cast Members Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
