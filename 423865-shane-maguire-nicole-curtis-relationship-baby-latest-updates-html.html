Shane and Nicole Curtis' case isn't a first, but among many in the entertainment industry who share bitter words in public after breaking up.</p><p class=align-left>And the media goes with the story, taking advantage of the publicity it attracts to their respective outlets. So, how did Shane Maguire and Nicole's relationship start and end? And what is the status of the legal custody of their baby?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth murders: What really happened?</span></p></a><h2>Who is Shane Maguire?</h2><p class=align-left>Shane Maguire is an American-born <a href=#>entrepreneur</a> that is currently separated from his ex-wife, Nicole Curtis. Although there isn't much information about Shane's background, it is known that he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born in Minnesota</a>. Also, he might be in his mid-40s currently.</p><p class=align-left>Shane gained popularity after he started dating Nicole Curtis. The fame even increased after they separated as they were primarily in the tabloids for the heated custody battle for their child.</p><p class=align-left>What does Shane Maguire do for a living? He is a <a href=#>business</a> partner of The Old Guys. He runs a chain of stores in Minnesota and California together with his co-owner Joe Beasy. They buy and sell gold items.</p><h2>Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Nicole started dating Shane sometime after the end of her first marriage to Steve Lane. This was back in 2009. Nicole <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parted ways </a>with Steve Lane a couple of years after they were married.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec0b422b381d0076.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Candy Jane Tucker: What you may not know about Steve-O's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The two were in an on and off relationship that ended after Nicole discovered that she was pregnant in 2014. So, did Nicole Curtis have her baby? She gave birth in 2015, but unfortunately, her relationship with Shane worsened.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, the father of Nicole Curtis' baby filed numerous motions in court against Nicole. This started a nasty divorce battle that dragged for three long years. The divorce battle was broadcasted for everyone to see. It came out as one of the most fierce and complicated court case battles ever witnessed in US <a href=#>family</a> courts.</p><h2>Custody battle</h2><p class=align-left>Nicole Curtis and Shane Maguire’s baby, Harper, has been dragged in a custody battle in court for some time now. So what was the contention about?</p><p class=align-left>It started with Shane seeking paternity, shared custody, and time with his son. Fortunately, the judge granted his request by ruling he could stay with his son during weekend visits. On top of this, the name Maguire was included in Harper’s birth certificate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/719908380f25cdee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are Jenny and Sumit from 90 Day Fiance still together in 2021?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, a few months after the ruling, Nicole Curtis filed another motion in court to contest the decision, seeking to deny Shane Maguire overnight stay with his son. And what was her main contention? Nicole said that she was still breastfeeding and required more time with her son during the nights.</p><p class=align-left>Things got even more interesting for the Rehab Addict custody battle actor. First, a judge ordered her to pump enough breast milk for her son during his time with his father. Then, she had to prove that she wasn't physically capable of doing so with the help of a lactation specialist.</p><p class=align-left>She posted her frustration on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> in 2017 in a hearty post.</p>Now, ask me about the struggle of having my breasts discussed in an open courtroom. Then the humiliation of having to put that document on public record and sit in a courtroom of strangers all privy to an open discussion about my body. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/60840c0a426486db.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Steve Damstra and Paget Brewster love story and relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At some point during their heated custody battle, Nicole Curtis' ex accused Nicole of using breastfeeding as an excuse to keep him away from his son. However, the actor responded by stating that she was practising baby-led weaning.</p><p class=align-left>And that was not all in the custody battle. Shane complained about Curtis' decision to move to California, claiming that it was abrupt and was after he had moved to Detroit to be closer to his son.</p><p class=align-left>The custody battle even became worse when in July 2018, Shane started pushing for Harper's sole custody. He claimed that Nicole wasn't fit to be a mother and attempted to destroy his <a href=#>relationship </a>with his son. Shane also stated that Nicole was messing up their meeting time and made co-parenting a big problem.</p><h3>Final settlement of the custody battle</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg><p class=align-left>Fortunately, in October 2018, Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis reached a joint agreement. As a result, they are now sharing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">equal responsibility</a> and decision-making authority over their child's well-being. This means they ought to discuss every critical decision about healthcare, religion, <a href=#>education</a> and other essential matters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/48e31aac3c133daa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kristen Rivers: What you never knew about Austin Rivers's mother</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Additionally, Shane and Nicole agreed to keep their matters out of the public to avoid tainting the boy's bond with any of his parents.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, the court settlement stated that neither parent could alter the child's physical appearance without consulting the other. This came about after Shane gave his son the first <a href=#>haircut </a>without his ex-wife’s approval.</p><p class=align-left>Nicole was instructed to create a $250,000 trust fund that Shane could access to buy a home in California near his son. However, he must have refunded the money before Harper turns 19.</p><p class=align-left>Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis have had a long custody battle, but fortunately, the contention ended as they decided to share parenting responsibilities. They are currently abiding by the terms set by the court and have not had any controversies about their child or relationship ever since.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about Billy Burke’s wife? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured a fascinating <a href=#>article</a> about the wife of one of America's most talented actors, singers and songwriters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/677f2340f7cb3a6a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>John Edward Thomas Moynahan: What you should know about Tom Brady's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although he has kept most of his life private, the public knows his wife, co-star Pollyanna Rose Williams, whom he married in June 2008.
