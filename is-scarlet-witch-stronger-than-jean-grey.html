In the world of video games, Jean Grey aka Phoenix has gone down in history as one of the most busted fighting-game characters ever in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. But when it comes down to it, is Scarlet Witch stronger than Jean Grey? Their individual strengths depend on several factors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Scarlet Witch stronger than Jean Grey? Let's break down our fighters.</h2><p>As one of the original <a href=#>X-Men</a>, Jean Grey is one of the most powerful mutants in existence. She's classified as an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Omega level mutant</a>, and her telepathic abilities and mastery over psionic energy surpass even that of her mentor, <a href=#>Charles Xavier</a>. She's a formidable mutant on her own, but her powers are further magnified by the cosmic might of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix Force</a>. As one of its primary hosts and the few who can keep the power in check, Jean can use it to become one of the most powerful beings in the universe.</p><p>Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch is an incredibly powerful sorcerer. In the comics, Scarlet Witch is a known anti-hero among the X-Men who was born with the ability to manipulate magic. Wanda has all sorts of spells and abilities at her disposal and is able to harness the various mystical energies of the universe. She can also tap into an unwieldy force known as <a href=#>Chaos Magic</a>, allowing her to alter reality itself to her will. She has even previously traveled the multiverse with relative ease.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Seeing as they are two of the most powerful women in X-Men lore, fans have often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered who would win</a> in a fight between them. Who could come out on top in a battle between mind and magic? It really depends on the situation.</p><p>Wanda has command over Chaos Magic on a consistent basis, thanks to the link she has with an old God of Chaos named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chthon</a>. Meanwhile, Jean can only do so much on her own as a telepath. She may be Omega-level, but all that power often puts a strain on her body.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj" readability=1><p></p><p>Jean Grey as she appears in 'Marvel vs. Capcom 3'</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That power gap was made evident in the comics. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reportedly</a>, Wanda took on the X-Men in an issue of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Men Forever 2</a>, with Jean Grey in the mix. Using her magic, Wanda was able to completely incapacitate Jean with relative ease. While that was the end of that round, it could have been a far different story if the Phoenix Force were involved.</p><p>The Phoenix Force is one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most powerful entities</a> in all of Marvel lore, and Jean just happens to be its favorite host. Though the Phoenix Force has possessed many heroes and villains in the past, it's arguably at its most powerful when it is joined with Jean.</p><p>The Scarlet Witch has never tussled with Jean Grey as the Phoenix before. But if Chaos Magic were to ever clash with the flaming fury of the cosmos, Wanda could very well end up as ashes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv8KaqaWdpGLEqsDCoWSsrKKku6ix0WaroZmeYremrc1mnqudqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./offlinetv-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Offline TV - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-foreman-sexual-abuse-allegations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George Foreman Denies Sexual Abuse Allegations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
