Anna first gained mainstream success through talking about relationship goals in her "I don't want it" series, and since then she has gained a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 million followers on TikTok</a> alone. But even though she's now a bona fide internet celebrity â€” with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own clothing line</a>, no less â€” she still remains relatable and authentic, which is why her fans can't get enough.</p><p>In preparation for the 2023 Women's World Cup, Anna has <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">partnered with LEGO</a> as part of Team Unstoppable â€” a group of inspiring women and girls with the goal of "[challenging] stereotypes around play and creative building, and [encouraging] girls to unlock the freedom they need to play without boundaries."</p><p>Distractify chatted with Anna, in collaboration with LEGO, to learn about her first concert, her dream collaboration, and more.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What's your go-to Starbucks order?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> The brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso every time.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What was the first concert you ever went to?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> I went to <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> with my older sister when I was in high school. I was like 14 and it was right after "A Team" was, like, topping charts and he was in really small theater in Michigan. So my sister and I drove all the way to Detroit to see him, and I got to leave school early, which was so cool in high school. ... He was incredible.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What is your most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> Right now, like the little teary eye, like the smiling with the little tears in the eyes (ðŸ¥¹)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@annaxsitar</span></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about the best fan interaction you've ever had:</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> I actually just had an event where I did a pop-up coffee shop here in LA at the Grove. And honestly, every single person that came through was just like the most warm and cozy and sweet individuals I've ever met. Everyone wanted to say hello and give a hug.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What's your favorite color?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> Yellow.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about the best meal you've ever had.</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> My mom's cooking â€” like, anything she cooks. I feel like that's everybody's comfort food. But my mom was born in Poland and grew up there, so she cooks really authentic Polish food, and that's what I grew up on. So like pierogis and sauerkraut and kielbasa and all that.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by anna x sitar (@annaxsitar)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What's your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> Ooh, something CÃ©line Dion. I grew up on CÃ©line Dion and we share a birthday, which is kind of a fun fact. I think "A New Day Has Come."</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creators!</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> Elaine from the LEGO team Unstoppable group. She is so high energy and fun and exciting, and everything she does, I'm looking forward to watching. So definitely Elaine.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Whatâ€™s one thing you wish more people knew about you?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> I feel like, maybe not about me specifically, but I think in a general sense ... we all are such multifaceted individuals that you can love so many things. Like, whether it's from my engineering degree and my love for cars and problem solving and getting my hands dirty, or it's from my more creative side â€” like, I just took pottery classes â€” and then working my photography and videography, whether it's any of my different interests. I feel like I wish more people knew about how ... people just have a million different ways to express [themselves].</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Share your top three desert island necessities.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Unsplash</span></figure><p><strong>AS:</strong> Probably sunscreen, because I burn very easily. So sunscreen. And maybe a good book and some matches to build a fire.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about your dream collaboration:</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> I think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Olympic gymnast] Suni Lee</a> would be one of mine, from Team Unstoppable. All those girls are so talented and incredible, and doing such innovative things with their content, with the way they show their life, with their community. But Suni is just somebody that, you know, she's so fun and playful and can do so many cartwheels and flips.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">If you couldn't be a content creator, what would your dream job be?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> Well, I studied engineering and I did med tech when I was doing that, so my focus was really in the medical field. I could never be a doctor because I get so lousy. But I loved creating products that helped people. But growing up, I always thought I would be a teacher, which is kind of funny and still different from my engineering degree. So I think all it wasn't a content creator probably be a teacher.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What is your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>AS:</strong> I'm moving into a new house, and I feel like what my distraction has been is â€” instead of actually getting furniture â€” I'm building all of my LEGO flower brick sets because I also can't keep a plant alive to save my life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZpinppFiwKrAwKs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerian-newspapers-daily-front-pages-review-sunday-20-february-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Newspapers Daily Front Pages Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./when-is-the-last-episode-of-last-man-standing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>'Last Man Standing' Is Set to Wrap up Its Story at the End of Season 9</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
