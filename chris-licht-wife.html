And I take full responsibility for that.”</p><p style=text-align:start>David also told staff, “This job was never going to be easy, especially at a time of great disruption and transformation. Chris poured his heart and soul into this job. Like all of you, he was in the line of fire and he’s taken a lot of hits. We appreciate his efforts, his passion, his love for journalism, and his love for this business.”</p><p>Chris hasn't shared what his next career move may be following the end of his 13-month tenure in CNN's top role.
