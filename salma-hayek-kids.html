The acclaimed actress-producer appears ageless and has even been dubbed <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most beautiful women in the world</a>. But her biggest superpower of all? Being a mom, of course!</p><p>Many folks know that Salma welcomed a daughter named Valentina back in 2007, but Valentina isn't actually her only child. When Salma <a href=#>married French businessman and billionaire François-Henri Pinault</a> in 2009, her family grew — by a lot. Here’s everything we know about Salma Hayek’s blended family and children.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Salma Hayek and daughter Valentina in March 2023</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many kids does Salma Hayek have?</h2><p>Salma has one biological daughter and three stepchildren.</p><p>In 2007, she welcomed daughter Valentina Paloma Pinault with then-fiancé François-Henri Pinault. Over the years, Valentina — who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoys photography</a> and can speak English, Spanish, and French — has accompanied her mom on projects and red carpets, from posing with each other for the May 2022 cover of Vogue Mexico to attending the Oscars together in May 2023.</p><p>Two years after Salma had Valentina, she married François-Henri, and suddenly she wasn't just a mom of one anymore. François-Henri has three other children from previous relationships.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Salma Hayek and husband François-Henri Pinault in May 2023</p></figure><p>François-Henri, the CEO and chairman of luxury group Kering, which owns fashion brands like Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, and Gucci, was previously in a relationship with supermodel <a href=#>Linda Evangelista</a> from 2005 to 2006. After the pair broke up, Linda welcomed their son Augustin James in October 2006 but remained very tight-lipped about who the father was. (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> referred to Augustin as her secret son.)</p><p>But in 2011, Linda took legal action against François-Henri and demanded he pay child support. Fortunately, the exes were able to work out a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custody settlement</a>. Since then, Salma has treated Augustin as one of her own. In August 2021, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cute vacation photo</a> of her and her teen stepson on Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@salmahayek</a><p>Salma Hayek and stepson Augustin (aka Augie) in August 2021</p></figure><p>François-Henri was also married to Dorothée Lepère from 1996 to 2004. They had two children together — son François and daughter Mathilde — with whom Salma also appears to be very close. When Mathilde celebrated her birthday in February 2021, Salma shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sweet photo of them</a> on Instagram. "My champion, you are such a bright light in our lives. I love you to the moon and back," she wrote in the caption.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@salmahayek</span><p>Salma Hayek and stepdaughter Mathilde in February 2021</p></figure><p>In June 2022, Salma posted a pic of the whole blended family together for Father's Day.</p><p>Salma doesn't post too often about all of her kids on Instagram, so it was a rare move for the actress, and her fans were certainly delighted to see the beautiful family all together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@salmahayek</a><p>François Pinault Jr.; Augustin "Augie" Pinault; Salma Hayek; François-Henri Pinault; Mathilde Pinault; and Valentina Pinault in June 2022</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Salma Hayek gave birth to Valentina at age 41.</h2><p>Salma did not become a mom until she was 41.

"I didn't know whether I was feeling bad because I was pregnant or whether something was seriously wrong," she later reflected to <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Parents</strong></a> in 2015. "I was nauseated for nine months, which can be one of the symptoms," she said. After that, she quietly stopped trying to have more kids.</p><p>Without going into too much detail about her medical history, Salma revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red</a> in 2017 that she had wanted more children at one point, but it wasn't in the cards for her. "I always wanted to have a lot of children, and I was not able to. My body, as a miracle, had one," she told the outlet.</p><p>Salma also acknowledged how fortunate she was to have become a stepmom: "The huge blessing I've had is that my husband has three other children. So I have four. And they are all so different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6tucBmn5qxlaB6rLXDrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-was-april-29-taylor-swift.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Was April 29? &amp;quot;High Infidelity&amp;quot; by Taylor Swift Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aly-raisman-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aly Raisman - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
