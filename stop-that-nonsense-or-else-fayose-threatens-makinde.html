In this West, I am his brother, I am his father.</p><p>“When Makinde was to contest, I was the one that presented the flag to him and a red pen. It is a higher authority that hangs your rank, a senior officer hangs the rank of a junior officer, that means he saw me as a leader at the time I was giving him the flag at Ogbomosho.</p><p>“It was Governor (Rasheed) Ladoja that was holding the structure that we gave to him (Makinde), I was the only sitting governor at the time. I had powers to influence it negatively. Are you telling me the man that gave you red pen has suddenly become your enemy? If he has anything against me, let him say it. Governor Makinde should take it easy.</p><p>“When they were contesting election in Oyo State, I was the one giving him information about the senatorial election. I never slept all night. In his own election, I was with him in Ibadan. If he disrespects us, we will tell him that we have capacity to… I am not his mate.</p><p>“If he wants peace, he should stop that nonsense, I say it again nonsense. I mean every word I am saying. I’m a responsible Nigerian. If we were born in the same family, I will be older than Governor Makinde by 10 years even if I was not governor. I should be respected. I am a respectable figure in this country, forget any other story any other politician may say.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FuZqysn6V6tbTArWSnp56osq%2B%2FxGamq2WVocCmecWasKirlWLBqb7EmquepqNiuqK3yKebnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./buhari-govt-knows-bandits-chiwetalu-agu-claims.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Buhari Govt Knows Bandits' - Chiwetalu Agu Claims</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./371003-sehemu-ya-barabara-kuu-ya-thika-kufungwa-kuanzia-ijumaa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sehemu ya barabara kuu ya Thika kufungwa kuanzia Ijumaa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
