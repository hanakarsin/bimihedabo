Whether you are doing soul searching in a relationship or not, there are simple steps that you can follow to do it properly.</p><h3>1. Look within yourself</h3><p class=align-left>Are you wondering how to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> do soul searching</a>? The first step is examining your immediate situation.</p><p class=align-left>To get to the heart of your life and have a more connected experience with yourself, you should view your life through a different lens than the one that you are currently using.</p><p class=align-left>Most people are not aligned with their inner selves because they have intense internal conflicts. Sit by yourself and ask, "Do I like what I see or hear within me?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4c46e883b310eead.jpeg><p class=align-left>Spend some time alone to recognize what you're missing and what your heart's desires are. Solitude is your greatest friend during introspection. Think about yourself when you are alone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3da78e3e55de8140.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 of the most inspirational Elon Musk quotes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>To get to know your inner self and have a better and more meaningful connection with yourself, you need to have time with yourself. You have to be intentional about creating "me-time."</p><h3>2. Look into the nature of your ego</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The human ego</a> appears to have form, but it changes constantly. This is why we put on different roles with different people.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, your ego can hinder growth of any kind because it is always trying to protect itself. It can be the biggest block to tasting and embodying who you really are.</p><p class=align-left>You can explore your ego via meditation, writing a journal, and self-inquiry. A soul searching book can also assist you with this.</p><h3>3. Work on reconnecting with your child self</h3><p class=align-left>Your inner child carries the original qualities of your soul, so you should reconnect with them. To do this, you can write a letter addressed to your inner child.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/edc2428923612dd0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 30 relatable loneliness quotes and sayings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can also do a child visualization or something that you enjoyed in your younger years. These activities should be done with caution so that you can make observations about your inner child.</p><p class=align-left>Reflect on how you are living today versus back then and learn the qualities from your past that you should integrate into your present-day life.</p><h3>4. Connect with nature and the wildness within you</h3><p class=align-left>Nature is both healing and rejuvenating for every human. Many times, we think of nature as separate from who we are, but the truth is that we are inseparable.</p><p class=align-left>We must realize that the center of our being is free and that we all need to get in touch with nature for us to grow. By <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">connecting with nature</a>, we re-discover ourselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/1296b4fff1d4c0a9.jpeg><p class=align-left>To do this, spend some time in the outdoors observing the clouds, trees, animals, and even the sun's rays. You can visit natural reserves or go for picnics as well. If you live in the city, visit your local park.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4026259ac41a6079.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Eckhart Tolle quotes of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Simple things such as observing an animal can teach you something new about your character.</p><h3>5. Ask yourself some soul searching questions</h3><p class=align-left>Questions offer a direct way of finding your personal truth. It takes a considerable amount of time to do introspection and to find out your true passions in life.</p><p class=align-left>To make it easier, you can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">use the following questions</a> to unearth your needs, wants, desires and goals:</p><ul><li>Who am I?</li><li>What is the meaning of life?</li><li>What is the one thing I have always wanted to do?</li><li>If I could spend the entire doing what I truly desire, what would it be?</li><li>How do I feel when I put all my effort into achieving one of my goals?</li><li>How do I feel whenever I achieve a goal?</li><li>Where do I really want to live, in which location and type of residence?</li><li>What places would I like to visit?</li><li>What is something that I talk about doing but never do?</li><li>What are the reasons I do not chase after my dreams?</li><li>What are the things that I would like to get rid of in my life?</li><li>Who are the people who inspire my life, and why?

Find your soul place</h3><p class=align-left>This refers to a physical location that speaks to your inner self. The place gives you a nostalgic longing, a sense of deep resonance.</p><p class=align-left>It does not necessarily have to be a dream location. It can be a mundane place that gives you deep peace. Spending time in this place allows you room to reflect and grow as an individual.</p><h3>7. Take part in one spiritual practice and evaluate your values</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spiritual practice you choose</a> does not have to be a religious practice. Practices such as meditation change the brain, nervous system, and mood.</p><p class=align-left>Do this for one hour or so a day, and your life will be more purpose-driven. You must also remember that your values shape who you are and how you do things.</p><p class=align-left>Are your values in line with your spirituality, and perhaps, religion?

Identify your source of energy</h3><p class=align-left>Different people gather their energy from different places. For some, peace comes from solitude, while others get energy from the people around them.</p><p class=align-left>Knowing your source of energy is instrumental in connecting with your inner self and feeling whole again.</p><h3>9. Evaluate the people who surround you</h3><p class=align-left>Are the people in your circle positive, encouraging, and kind? The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">people you surround yourself</a> with influence who you become in life.</p><p class=align-left>You are unlikely to find the true meaning and purpose of your life if you interact with toxic, malicious, and selfish people day in and out.</p><p class=align-left>You must be aware that cutting people out of your circles, especially those you have been close to for an extended period, is a daunting task.

While soul searching definition makes it look easy, it is a challenging task, and many people have failed to do it properly.</p><p class=align-left>For this reason, we have compiled ten quotes to encourage and motivate you to do it properly.</p><ul><li>Stop looking outside for scraps of pleasure for fulfillment, for validation, security, or love – you have a treasure within that is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer. – <i>Eckhart Tolle</i></li><li>Give yourself the gift of time in coming to answers for your life... It takes time, and a lot of introspection and soul-searching, to get clear about what you really want to manifest in your life. – <i>David Emerald Womeldorff</i></li><li>You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. – <i>Alan Alda</i></li><li>And in this game of life, we all search for ourselves. When I say selves, I mean 'inner selves,' the thing that created life in the first place. Now consciously, most of us are not aware of this. But if you're searching for happiness, if you're searching for tranquility; if you're searching just to have a nice, peaceful, loving, understanding life... in actual fact, your searching for your inner self. – <i>Sydney Banks</i></li><li>To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself. – <i>Thich Nhat Hanh</i></li><li>Life is like a game of chess. To win, you have to make a move. Knowing which move to make comes with IN-SIGHT and knowledge, and by learning the lessons that are accumulated along the way. We become each and every piece within the game called life! – <i>Allan Rufus</i></li><li>A person who does not understand your soul can give you only winter! And you too, you can give nothing but winter to the person whose soul you did not understand! – <i>Mehmet Murat ildan</i></li><li>But I do believe that's when you do your soul-searching. I think when you have these trials that life gives you, it is an opportunity to find out who you are. Not just who you are when everything's great, but who are you when everything is taken away from you, and you have nothing. – <i>Ellen DeGeneres</i></li><li>Mindfully practicing authenticity during our most soul-searching struggles is how we invite grace, joy, and gratitude into our lives. –<i> Brené Brown</i></li><li>I am not shy about admitting my modest talents. For example, I am happy to admit that I am better than average at clever remarks, and I also have a flair for getting people to like me. But to be perfectly fair to myself, I am ever-ready to confess my shortcomings, too, and a quick round of soul-searching forced me to admit that I had never been any good at all at breathing water. As I hung there from the seat belt, dazed and watching the water pour in and swirl around my head, this began to seem like a very large character flaw. – <i>Jeff Lindsay</i></li></ul><p class=align-left>Soul searching is essential in every human being's life, especially when you feel lost and without any motivation in life.
