It would later be known as the #DelenaRainKiss on Twitter, and was talked about for the rest of the series' existence. If we're honest, people are still talking about it to this day. Hi, we're the people!</p><p>When Damon (<a href=#>Ian Somerhalder</a>) and Elena (<a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a>) locked lips during a torrential downpour, the world collectively gasped. It was so significant that Ian brought it up at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PaleyFest LA </a>that same year. He even took advantage of the hashtag trending on Twitter. Apparently, fans wanted more "Delena Rain Kisses" but Ian was quick to say that it can get quite cold in Georgia, where they were filming. That begs the question, where was the show filmed exactly and would a warmer climate have changed things?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Delena LR (video still)</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'The Vampire Diaries' filming locations prove that the devil did go down to Georgia.</h2><p>Although The Vampire Diaries is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Va., it was filmed in Covington, Ga. Hollywood has flocked to the Peach State for its tax breaks, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Covington has seen more than its fair share of productions</a>. From movies like Remember the Titans and My Cousin Vinnie, to shows like The Dukes of Hazzard and <a href=#>Sweet Magnolias</a>, Covington is the perfect place to adapt to whatever town the script calls for.</p><p>Every teen show needs a hangout spot. People of a certain age will undoubtedly think of the Peach Pit on Beverly Hills 90210 or The Max on Saved by the Bell. Having one place to congregate gives the set designers a bit of a break. In The Vampire Diaries, the characters were usually at the Mystic Grill. At least one of them (Matt Donovan) worked there. Believe it or not, Covington doubled down on this and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">built their own Mystic Grill</a>. They source their ingredients locally. Sorry, they don't serve blood.</p><p>We could probably never nail down how often people on the show strolled through the downtown area where the most iconic building is undoubtedly the clock tower. One unforgettable scene incorporated the clock tower. Damon and Elena were sitting in front of the clock's face, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing the cure for vampirism</a>. It ends with them holding hands and leaping off together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Covington, Ga (@discovercovington)</a></p></figure><p>If vampires aren't your bag and you have a thing for werewolves, pop over to Worthington Manor which is where Tyler Lockwood and his pack lived. Anytime they needed a fancy party or a reason to celebrate Founder's Day, the gang headed to Lockwood Mansion. This place must have been built on a cemetery because it attracts all kinds of energy. Who could forget that the first time Klaus killed Mikael was on the steps of this very house?</p><p>The other infamous homes frequented on the show are the Gilbert's house, which Elena set fire to after Jeremy died, and of course the Salvatore house. Both are private residences although the Salvatore house was two different homes," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>. The first can be found in British Columbia and the second is outside of Atlanta. The addresses are available online so if you go, please be respectful of the homeowners. Don't make it weird!</p><p>The first TVD spinoff was The Originals, which started in Covington and eventually made its way to New Orleans. Clearly, someone was taking a page out of an Anne Rice novel. Of course, Legacies, which was an Originals spinoff, returned to Mystic Falls/Covington and was primarily located in the Salvatore house which became a Hogwarts of sorts for supernatural kids. For our money, The Originals is the best of the three but no one needs a valid excuse to head to the Big Easy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq66uvMirnGacmZa%2FqrHSZp2ipJ2eu6h5y6iamqyZpLu0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-mescal-sister.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Mescal's Sister Details on His Sibling's Music Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./salvatore-schillaci-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Salvatore Schillaci - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
