Amid anxieties, troublemakers have been warned of dire consequences if they fail to conduct themselves before, during and after the day’s exercise.</p><p>The security agencies’ warning came as concerned stakeholders, including traditional rulers and religious leaders, sued for peace.</p><p>The DHQ said the military had been informed of the intentions of certain individuals associated with specific candidates to masquerade as military personnel to cause disturbances during the elections.</p><p>It warned that there would be consequences for persons or groups planning to disguise themselves as personnel during the election, stressing that such action will not be tolerated as the military will not allow its image to be destroyed.</p><p>Director of Defence Media Operations, <strong>Major-General Edward Buba,</strong> gave the warning while briefing on military operations to counter threats of terrorists, bandits/kidnappers, oil theft perpetrators and other forms of insecurity across the country.</p><p>He said: “For the off-season <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>elections</strong></a> in Bayelsa, Imo, and Kogi states taking place this weekend, Here is a message for you. The military is deployed in strength for the election to create a safe environment for voters to come out and cast their votes peacefully.</p><p>“However, we are aware of plans of some to disguise themselves in military gear to orchestrate havoc and disrupt elections in some areas. Our message to such a group is that there will be injurious consequences for such an action. The military will not fold its arms and watch its image dragged to the mud.”</p><p>The military also warned its troops about potential violations of electoral guidelines or disruptive behaviour. The consequences of such actions it said could result in a court-martial, as the military has made it clear that they will not tolerate any misconduct.</p><p>“It is important to highlight that the AFN (Armed Forces of Nigeria) is a disciplined and well-trained force that conducts its operation within the ambit of laws governing human rights and that of armed conflict. We have rules of engagement that are followed in the course of our actions,”&nbsp;the DHQ added.</p><p>Earlier, IGP Egbetokun announced the redeployment of 14 Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIGs) and 26 Commissioners of Police, CPs, with immediate effect.</p><p>Also, the DSS cautioned individuals and organizations about refraining from making inflammatory remarks prior to the elections, emphasizing that the use of aggressive language may disrupt the smooth and organized process of conducting peaceful elections in the three states.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5BpZp2goWKxtL%2BMop6pZaKarqV50aKmrWWRmMFutM6uqaxlpKR6qrnOZqKon5lir6LFxKWqmmWfm7Nur9ico55llaGypMDIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./february25-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>February 25 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./forever-now-song-this-is-us.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A New Song in 'This Is Us' Brought Us All to Tears Here's What It All Means</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
