We wanted to prove to them that the man is very acceptable, not only in his home base but throughout the country.</p><p>“We want everybody in the South-West to rally around this man and support him and so far we have been very successful.</p><p>“We have moved round the palaces to see most of our top traditional rulers who have endorsed him.</p><p>“Charity begins at home; we wanted to solidify the Homebase. Once the home base is solidified, I believe other Nigerians, particular in our party, will feel more comfortable to field this candidate, knowing that he can win the election for them.”</p><p>Speaking on the chances of Tinubu in the 2023 elections, the APC chieftain said, “Don’t forget that one of the selling points for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 was that he already had 12 million votes in his pocket (in previous elections) particularly in the North-West and North-East. So, it was easy with support from a few other places for him to win the presidency.</p><p>“We are also saying that come 2023, the man we are projecting already has at least 12 to 13 million votes in his pocket and so it will be easy.”</p><p>Asked how sure he was about his statistics, Adeyeye said, “I am giving it (figure) based on what I have seen on ground having to transverse the length and breadth of the South-West and having seen people from political parties saying that when it comes to the issue of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, they will shed their partisan toga and embrace him and vote for him. I have seen that in the palaces of the Obas, amongst artisans and market women.</p><p>“When it comes to the issue of the Presidency in 2023, all of these people in unison, they will shed every differences and vote for this man.</p><p>“The votes in the South-West is more than 20 million votes. I am only saying 12 to 13 million votes is already assured and I say it with all sense of responsibility without fear of contradiction that those 12 to 13 votes are already in the bag.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49xZmtoYmh6tbXNrpmuZZGhv6atw7JkoZmmmnpyfoymoKWkmaS7bsLOrZysZaOsrqitjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-taylor-voiceactor-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Arnold Taylor - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sunday-igboho-drags-buhari-govt-to-court-demands-e2-82-a65-1bn-damages.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sunday Igboho Drags Buhari Govt To Court, Demands 5.1bn Damages</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
