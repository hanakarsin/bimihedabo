At that time, he had already achieved significant success in his work in the banking sector. Many people were shocked by the fact that in 1992 he refused to work in a prestigious and secured company but decided to start his own project. At that time, IMB was one of the leading Nigerian banks. It was believed that it's not reasonable to leave there.</p><p class=align-left>The entrepreneur had the courage to go his own way. First, SystemSpecs performed the functions of a partner in the British company Systems Union, offering software products for accounting. Over time, Obaro gained more confidence, making his project the most demanded software company in Nigeria which is focused on needs of local population. More than 150 Nigerian specialists of various professions worked together for the benefit of this firm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt54i14ue2dsr.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 businessmen in Nigeria</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5sro72p02h2.jpg><h2>Mr. Emmanuel Ocholi</h2><p class=align-left>This is another director of the company.
