We came back, we had security issues, you were our minister. For most of the approvals you saw from the President, it was this man (Amaechi) that was pushing for us. Amaechi was our minister, not minding that he is from Rivers State. We got almost everything.”</p><p>“They mentioned railway, but you brought Shipper’s Council to us, you restored our inland container to us, so many things that you did. As I’m talking, the first set of people you took to China, seven of them are Plateau boys, and very soon they are coming back as experts in engineering. We can go on and on.</p><p>“We had already taken a decision; all former members of the Houses of Assembly decided that wherever you go, we would follow you. So, if you calculate the number of former Speakers that we have in Nigeria, I think you already have 30 per cent votes.”</p><p>The Majority Leader of the Plateau State House of Assembly, Yakubu Sande, also declared bloc support for Amaechi.</p><p>Sande said, “I have the privilege to move this historic motion and say categorically, that members of the Plateau State House of Assembly, Chairmen of the 17 Local Government Areas, we have super delegates and national delegates, all represented today, and what I’m doing today is an endorsement by the delegates of Plateau State.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FqZrCgqWK2bsPOp6tmq6WlvbC%2B02alqKqknbKzusSrZJqok2K9s7HSopuepqSerq15wKynoqqRo8G0ecuao6iml2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./357689-covid-19-umuhimu-wa-kupima-ili-kufahamu-ikiwa-umeambukizwa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>COVID-19: Umuhimu wa kupima ili kufahamu ikiwa umeambukizwa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pawn-stars-cast-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Kind of Net Worth Does the Cast of 'Pawn Stars' Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
