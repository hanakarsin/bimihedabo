Well, the Pawn Stars cast members have individually done very well for themselves in the financial sector.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rick Harrison — $9 million</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As the head honcho over at the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, Rick Harrison has accrued a seriously impressive net worth. He has worked alongside his father to operate the current shop ever since its 1989 opening, and played an integral role in getting them featured on the History Channel program that made them famous. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Rick has about $9 million to his name.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Corey "Big Hoss" Harrison — $4 million</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Rick's son and the next in line for the Pawn Stars throne, Corey "Big Hoss" Harrison has worked at his family shop ever since he was young. Much like his father, he has become a cunning buyer who facilitated plenty of big-ticket deals for the shop over the years. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he is worth roughly $4 million.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Austin "Chumlee" Russell — $5 million</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Corey's best friend from childhood onward, Austin "Chumlee" Russell is about as much of an honorary member of the Harrison family as one could be. He has worked at the shop ever since he turned 21 and thanks to Pawn Stars became a lovable reality television personality, something that he has leveraged into individual fame as well. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he has roughly $5 million to his name and makes about $25,000 per episode of Pawn Stars.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Richard "The Old Man" Harrison — $8 million</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although he passed away back in 2018, Richard "The Old Man" Harrison is the reason that Pawn Stars even exists. He founded his first pawn shop back in 1981 and co-operated it with his wife, Joanne Rhue. The second and current shop came in 1989 and some years later, his son, Rick, assumed control. Richard was an integral part of the shop's day-to-day activities up until his death and a fan-favorite on the show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he had a net worth of $8 million prior to his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa64uoysq5qqo2Kwor%2FTZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-i-wont-support-northerner-apc-presidential-aspirants-lalong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why I Wont Support Northerner APC Presidential Aspirants Lalong</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-griffin-iii-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Griffin III Is Married to a Fitness Entrepreneur</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
