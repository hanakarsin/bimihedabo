And no matter how much you love a person, this situation isn't easy. You're going to get annoyed by some of the little things your partner does. Writer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lizzie O'Leary</a> asked people to share the petty complaints people have about their partners in quarantine. If you are stuck in a house with someone you care deeply about, this thread is probably way too relatable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Lizzie shares that she notoriously leaves her tea mug on the kitchen counter. "My husband, on the other hand, is incapable of pushing in his chair after leaving the table," she writes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Walks too heavily</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I don't quite understand how one walks too heavily. Is this person stomping all over the place? Dragging their feet? This is hard to complain about.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cleans too quickly</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Oh no! Your partner cleans up your mess "before you have a chance to clean it up" yourself, aka probably after it's been sitting out for hours and she simply can't take it anymore. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chews food</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This person isn't complaining that their partner chews loudly or with their mouth open. No. This person can't stand that their partner chews food. Period. Why can't they swallow everything whole for love?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Breathes like that</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The problem is that now he's going to become so self-conscious of his breathing that it's only going to get worse, and then neither of them will be able to take it anymore. I think they might have to stop sharing an office.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Leaves cheese wrappers everywhere</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Is it just cheese wrappers? Everything else, he has no problem throwing in the trash? Why are some people like this? What is the mental block? I don't understand. He's in the kitchen. There's probably a trash can right there.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Opens pretzels</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Is it the opening of the bag or the eating of the pretzels that she can't stand? Does he crinkle it extra loudly? Is it a certain pretzel brand? Are pretzel bags worse than other bags? I have so many questions.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Doesn't reset the microwave</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is definitely a pet peeve of anyone with a soul. It's a compulsion of mine to reset the microwave if I stop it before the countdown. I can't relax if I know "0:07" is still flashing on the screen.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Slices up lemon for no reason</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This one... I have no words. It's truly baffling. Why would one take out a knife and a cutting board and slice up an entire lemon if you have no intention of using it? It's madness! Do you know how quickly they dry out once they're cut open?!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Won't remove toilet paper roll</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I feel like this is an elaborate troll job. No one does this. I've heard of people not changing the toilet paper roll at all and leaving the next person with no toilet paper, but this woman goes through the trouble of replacing the roll, yet can't toss the old cardboard into the recycling? Psychotic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Loads dishwasher incorrectly</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>It might be a cliché, but it's true: There is a correct way to load the dishwasher, and if you do it wrong, you're a monster.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Plays an airplane landing game</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Oh, I hate this! High-pitched beeps are never good! Those are the sounds of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms. So much anxiety gets triggered with an high-pitched beep. It's time to invest in some headphones.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mumbles across the apartment</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This is starting to happen in my apartment. It's getting very hot where we are, so we have the window unit air conditioners on, and when they're going, neither of us can hear a thing the other is saying. It will either save us or destroy us.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gets sourdough starter everywhere</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>How does this happen? I know you have to discard some of the starter every day, but shouldn't it go either straight into the trash or into another baking project? Where is he flinging this stuff?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Asks what their partner did today</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Oh ho ho, I would not take kindly to this question. Obviously, the answer is, "You know exactly what I did today. You were there the entire time." As if I need another reminder that we're stuck at home together 24/7. Thanks a lot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK1wNhmp5qqpKOys3nCqKSppJGeu7W%2FjKqsmqqRo8GqusQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-a-canon-event-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is a Canon Event?
