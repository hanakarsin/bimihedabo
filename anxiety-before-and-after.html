Top picture: What I showcase to the world via social...</p>Posted by <a href=#>Amber Louise Smith</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunday, April 3, 2016</a></figure><p>The rest of her caption reads:</p>I'm so sick of the fact that it's 2016 and there is still so much stigma around mental health. It disgusts me that so many people are so uneducated and judgemental over the topic. They say that 1 in 3 people will suffer with a mental illness at some point in their life. 1 in 3! Do you know how many people that equates to worldwide?! And yet I've been battling with anxiety and depression for years and years and there's still people that make comments like 'you'll get over it', 'you don't need tablets, just be happier', 'you're too young to suffer with that'<br>FUCK YOU. Fuck all of you small minded people that think that because I physically look 'fine' that I'm not battling a monster inside my head every single day.<br>Someone actually said this to me one day 'aren't you too young to be suffering with anxiety and depression? What do you actually have to be depressed about at your age?' Wow, just wow.<br>I'm a strong person, I've been through my fair share of crap in life (the same as anyone else) and I will be okay. I have the best family and friends around me and I am thankful everyday that they have the patience to help and support me.<br>To anyone who is going through the same, please do not suffer in silence. There is so much support around - Don't be scared to ask for help.<br>This is why I can't stress enough that it costs nothing to be nice to others. Don't bully others, don't put others down and the hardest one of them all (as we have all done it at some point) don't judge another person. We're all human regardless of age, race, religion, wealth, job. So build one another up instead of breaking each other down.<br>Peace & love guys ☮<p>The post has since been shared over 11,000 times. Among the comments are dozens of messages of support:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"></figure><p>Following all the attention the post received, Smith edited the post to include then following message:</p>"Please don't be afraid to share this, there needs to be more awareness. The more awareness there is, the less people who will suffer in silence."<h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>30-Year-Old Evicted from His Parents’ House Gives the Cringiest Interview Ever</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>These Shameless Girls Bragged About Stealing a Tip Jar — But the Internet Tracked Them Down</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Girl Found out Her Boyfriend Was Cheating from a Jimmy Johns Delivery Guy</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWt8cYCOamdoaYCrw6vGjpqlsaGVqcZursSfpqudXZa7pXnAn6ueqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabe-and-isabel-married-90-day-fiance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabe and Isabel From 90 Day Fianc: The Other Way May Save Their Wedding for Next Season</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maimie-mccoy-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maimie McCoy - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
