Students have the liberty to attempt two sections of a part in one sitting or separately in ascending order. Proceeding to the next level is only allowed after the lower sections have been passed. The good thing with the CPA course is that one can get a job even with a few sections completed thus empowering individuals financially as they cater for their needs to complete the remaining parts.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/54dd230e6022a760.jpeg><p class=align-left>The big question here is what does it take for one to qualify as a CPA student in Kenya?
