Joel is a resident of Texas, one of nine states in the USA that has no income tax.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Joel and his wife are subject to paying federal income taxes, however, there are probably a lot of ways that the couple can either extremely mitigate, or get out of paying that money.</p><p>Joel says that all of his income comes from book sales, and he earns an average of $3.5 million every year from said book sales and other religious events/ventures.</p><p>Since he's a member of the Lakewood Church, Joel can technically receive a bunch of allowances and stipends for his travel and lodging. These funds are not taxable.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Theoretically, he can also have credit cards and other expense accounts through the church that he is not obligated to pay taxes on. The Lakewood Church is a huge money-making entity that has around a $90 million annual budget, so it's crazy to think that they don't have a top legal and accounting team making sure that everything is on the up and up, especially on paper.</p><p>There are a lot of people who like to point out Joel Osteen's "hypocritical" ways, like the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wouldn't open his megachurch to provide shelter</a> in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.&nbsp;</p><p>Or the fact that he said Lakewood didn't receive any federal assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic...but then it was revealed they were given some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.4 million from the U.S. government</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Um, Steven Mnuchin funneled $455B of PPP Covid relief loans and gave millions to himself, Kushner, Devin Nunes, Betsy DeVos, Joel Osteen, Kanye West, Tom Brady, $334,000 to Moscow Mitch’s wife Elaine Chao.

And although he's been the subject of controversy in the past, he hasn't come under any significant legal trouble even though he's the religious face of a non-profit but manages to earn so much cash.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Other megachurch pastors haven't been so fortunate, however. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirbyjon Caldwell</a> was actually sentenced to six years in prison for reportedly "swindling" people out of millions of dollars in the name of God.</p><p>According to WILX, the senior pastor of the Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston got some people from his 14,000 member congregation to invest in a Chinese bonds scam.</p><p>The bonds had no financial value, and he allegedly used the roughly $3.5 million to fund debt, mortgage, and loan payments, as well as supplant his lifestyle and pay off credit cards. He was ordered to fork over $3,588,500 and was slapped with a $125,000 fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yjpp6kXaTAtbHEp2SpmaliwaLExKw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ex-commissioner-kills-friend-during-argument-on-dating-18-year-old-school-girl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ex-Commissioner Kills Friend During Argument On Dating 18-Year-Old School Girl</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./old-bodybuilder-home-intruder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>An 82-Year-Old Bodybuilder Grandma Sent a Home Intruder to the Hospital</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
