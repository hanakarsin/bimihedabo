One CEO thinks he‚Äôs figured it out based on his email signature.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Jamie Lerner</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated May 3 2024, 8:10 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images/Twitter/@IGoBySteve</a></figure><p>Every so often, something happens in our work life that warrants a tweet. For a father of two named Steve, all it took was an email from his <a href=#>newly appointed CEO</a>. He shares an <a href=#>email signature</a> for an email sent after hours that encourages employees to email when it‚Äôs convenient for them. People can‚Äôt figure out if it‚Äôs a positive sentiment or an unnecessary clause when scheduling emails is an option.</p><p>As people discuss the CEO‚Äôs after-hours email, it brings about a larger discourse about how to properly manage a work-life balance in a way that respects other people‚Äôs <a href=#>work-life balances</a>. Perhaps what works for us doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, and while we might think we have the answers, an email clause doesn‚Äôt necessarily solve all the problems. So what does?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@IGoBySteve</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A CEO added a clause to his after-hours email signature to promote a healthy work-life balance.</h2><p>On April 22, 2024, Steve (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@IGoBySteve</a>) shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">short anecdote about his new CEO</a>. ‚ÄúJust got an after-hours email from my new CEO and noticed he added this little disclaimer. You love to see it,‚Äù he tweeted. He then shared a screenshot of the disclaimer with the CEO‚Äôs name conveniently blacked out for anonymity.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just got an after hours email from my new CEO and noticed he added this little disclaimer.

Managing work and life responsibilities is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's what's in my signature: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/huqobkthqQ</a></p>‚Äî Amanda Bü§®wer (@heyprofbow) <a href=#>April 23, 2024</a></figure><p>While some were quick to applaud the CEO, including Steve, others were skeptical of his true motives. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be fooled. That CEO is low-key testing you,‚Äù one of the top comments said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt HAVE to respond right then, but your choice will definitely be remembered.‚Äù We hope that‚Äôs not the case since this CEO seems sincere, but it does give the same energy as the classic internet meme saying, ‚ÄúNo worries‚Äù when one has all of the worries.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We love a company that values work life balance</p>‚Äî brandon s.

Most people don‚Äôt want to receive emails after work because they‚Äôll still get the notification and that could weigh on them as something to add to the to-do list. Others will worry about forgetting to respond during the following work day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>All good points, but like a lot of us have been saying, Outlook scheduled send is not reliable at all.</p>‚Äî The Tortured Steve Department (@IGoBySteve) <a href=#>April 23, 2024</a></figure><p>On the other hand, it‚Äôs very possible that this type of position doesn‚Äôt require someone to be online for a specific set of hours and that everyone may check in and out of the job throughout the day. Some jobs allow people to do other things while they work ‚Äî take care of children, cook food, etc. ‚Äî and employees might have an hour or two at night when they finish up their work.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man, I love that. I try to tell all of my team that I email at odd hours only because I sometimes take time off during ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hours. Family thing? Take time away. Wanna exercise in the middle of the day? Fine! I like the way your CEO put it.</p>‚Äî Kevin Wessman (@KevinWessman) <a href=#>April 23, 2024</a></figure><p>And some people were so impressed with the email sign-off that they vowed to steal it for themselves! As for us? I wrote this article just before midnight because that‚Äôs when it was most convenient, so I can definitely empathize with the CEO.</p><p>And his self-awareness that his style may not work for everyone is what sets him apart. If Steve seems to love the disclaimer as one of his employees, so do we!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKwecCfq56qXZ28tr7SZpymmZmh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lagos-seeks-stakeholders-compliance-with-real-estate-laws.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lagos Seeks Stakeholders Compliance With Real Estate Laws</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-we-will-deliver-12-million-votes-for-peter-obi-nlc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>2023: We Will Deliver 12 Million Votes For Peter Obi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
