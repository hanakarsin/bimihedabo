Though most of the app's younger users had parents who were born in the 80s, this trend has become popular with creators who have parents or grandparents who remember how they moved and grooved in that decade.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@montoyaahne1</a></figure><p>For the most part, this trend is set to a clip of the song "Smalltown Boy" by Bronski Beat, which was released in 1984.

"The hair was so fluffy too! Everyone was sweaty, and lots of glazed eyes. But it looked like a fever dream."</p><p>"Smalltown Boy" was part of Bronski's debut album, The Age of Consent. The song is about a young gay man who finds himself isolated from his family and friends after coming out. Though the clip shared on TikTok doesn't showcase any of the song's lyrics, it was an incredibly popular synth-pop song from the time period.</p><p>Not all TikTok trends are as fun and lighthearted as this one is, but occasionally the app's users will share moments that give a brief moment of warmth while scrolling through the For You page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vr8Rmo6KjlWK2tb%2BMrZ%2BeZWhlwG7AyKSrqKNdqb%2BmusM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wyo-chi-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WYO Chi - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./407493-jamaa-afufuka-dakika-chache-baada-ya-madaktari-kutangaza-kifo-chake-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jamaa Afufuka Dakika Chache Baada ya Madaktari Kutangaza Kifo chake</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
