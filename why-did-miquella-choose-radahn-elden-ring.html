The acclaimed FromSoftware title has players assume the role of the Tarnished, an outsider from the Lands Between who faces off against demigods on their mysterious quest to repair the titular Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord. In 2024, players can now move beyond the Lands Between.</p><p>On June 21, 2024, a massive DLC expansion was released for Elden Ring. Shadow of the Erdtree introduces a completely new area known as the Land of Shadow. Here, the Tarnished pursues Miquella of the Haligtree, an Empyrean and twin brother to <a href=#>Malenia</a> who is given a much larger antagonistic role in the DLC. In his quest to bring about the "Age of Compassion," he uses Radahn as a consort to achieve his goals. Now, players are wondering why he chose Radahn out of anyone else. Here's what people think.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: FromSoftware</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Radahn seemed to be the best choice for Miquella's goals in 'Shadow of the Erdtree'.</h2><p>Radahn originally appears as an optional boss in the original Elden Ring, though he holds one of the shards of the Elden Ring necessarily for various storylines in the game. He ended up becoming one of the most popular boss characters in the game, with fans and critics praising both his tragic backstory and boss battle. It should come as no surprise that he returns in a big way in Shadow of the Erdtree as Miquella's chosen consort and one of the major bosses in the DLC.</p><p>According to the lore, Radahn and Miquella made a vow with each other as children. Miquella had promised that once he fulfilled his ambition of ascending to godhood, he would appoint Miquella as his new Elden Lord. To that end, Miquella revives the fallen Radahn and positions him as a major threat. Toward the end of the DLC, the Tarnished faces off against Radahn in two new forms befitting of the vow he made with Miquella: Promised Consort Radahn and Radahn, Consort of Miquella.</p><p>As for why Miquella specifically chose Radahn, players are still curious. According to a fan on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/eldenringdiscussion subreddit</a>, Miquella could have easily chosen any demigod to be his consort. Many have since suggested that Radahn was simply the strongest demigod at his disposal, making him an obvious choice from a pragmatic angle. However, Radahn is also known for his fierce loyalty to those he has pledged to protect and fights valiantly for Miquella's ambitions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: FromSoftware</a></figure><p>Their strong connection is made apparent in Radahn's form as a final boss in the DLC, which sees him fighting the Tarnished with Miquella riding on his back. While the details of their connection aren't wholly explicit, their relationship with each other has proven to be one of the most powerful forces in the Land of Shadows.</p><p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is available on all platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2almabCprjLmmScoJ%2BkwKZ50ZqbmqCeYrKtsMSnZKuhnpw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1254935-80-funny-dark-jokes-puns-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>130+ funny dark humor jokes and puns that will definitely crack you up</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-senator-bulkachuwa-dumps-apc-shows-off-pdp-membership-card-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Senator Bulkachuwa Dumps APC, Shows Off PDP Membership Card (Photo)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
