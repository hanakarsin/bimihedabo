The dating competition show brings a fun new twist: its contestants are looking for both a singing partner and a soulmate.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sheridan Reed</u></a> is one of this season’s contestants, and he has certainly captured our attention with his many hats and love for his Subaru “Sheila.” Here’s what we know about Sheridan (including whether he finds love this season).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Meet Sheridan from 'Listen to Your Heart':</h2><p>Although this is Sheridan’s first reality TV appearance, he’s no stranger to the spotlight. He has enjoyed quite a bit of popularity over the past couple of years due to his burgeoning music career. In 2018, he released his debut single “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>We Should Both Be Here</u></a>.” The music video followed shortly thereafter, along with plenty of eyeballs watching it (nearly a quarter-million pairs of ‘em so far!).&nbsp;</p><p>In the summer of 2019, Sheridan had his first international performance in Paris. Just a few months later, he released his second single, “All In,” then announced he would be an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official artist at SXSW 2020</u></a>. Of course, SXSW 2020 was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing Sheridan to postpone his SXSW debut and other shows. But we can still watch him on Listen to Your Heart! Luckily for us, the show wrapped up filming way back on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Feb. 12</u></a> (seems like a lifetime ago, huh?).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It’s a strange time to be alive. ⠀ ⠀ When people have been asking me how I’m doing throughout the last month, as things have gone from good to bad to worse for the world overall it seems, my response hasn’t changed a whole lot. ⠀ ⠀ Overall—I’m trying to stay positive in the face of all the uncertainty of what life will look like in the months to come, maybe years. A month ago I was getting ready for my first major music festival as an official artist with several other shows lined up. As we all know that didn’t happen, but it’s okay. We will have festivals again, we will have shows again, we will have normalcy again, even if it’s a bit different than what we were used to. Things change and that’s part of life. ⠀ ⠀ I’ve been trying to focus on maintaining positivity, and in my day to day trying to find a balance between self-discipline, and self-grace. I’m glad I’m setting goals for myself: forming consistent healthy habits for my body, reading fiction for fun and nonfiction for learning my mind, writing music and painting for my creativity, admin and emails for my business, catching up with family and friends through video chat for my social life and sanity, and getting into nature for peace. ⠀ ⠀ I’m trying to do everything, while also trying to remember it’s okay if I don’t get to everything every single day. Resting is as important as working, and sometimes I need a day like yesterday to do nothing but watch Netflix and make both salsa and chocolate chip cookies from scratch lol just trying to find that balance, and I hope everyone else is too. ⠀ ⠀ Use this time to read that book, or hey maybe even write that book you’ve been putting off. Make that meal you thought was too complicated. Pickup that hobby you’ve been curious about. Listen to that full album instead of just that one song you like. ⠀ ⠀ But more importantly I hope you also take time for yourself to breath and find some peace. ⠀ ⠀ 📸: @ericmphoto</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Sheridan Reed</a> (@sheridanreed) on Apr 5, 2020 at 8:26am PDT</p></figure><p>Even though he’s stuck at home like the rest of us, the self-described “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pop soul</u></a>” artist plans to continue working on new music for his fans (probably a good idea, as now is the perfect time to capitalize on his TV appearance!). He recently released another new single, “Too Little Too Late” On April 13, and (according to his website) plans to release another single and a full EP in May.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Sheridan and Julia still together?</h2><p>In the first episode of Listen to Your Heart, Sheridan initially appeared to be a bit of an underdog when it came to winning fellow contestant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Julia Rae</u></a>’s affections. Then he blew her (and us!) away with a surprise performance of an original song and was rewarded with a rose. Naturally, we need to know whether Sheridan and Julia are still together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>If you haven’t watched episode 1 of #ListentoYourHeart yet, make sure you DUET before episode 2 airs Monday 8/7c on @abcnetwork (yes, I went there) • ALSO!!
