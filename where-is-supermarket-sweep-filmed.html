The current iteration of the popular game show was filmed at an airport hangar near this popular destination.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Ever since its premiere on ABC in 1965, <a href=#>Supermarket Sweep</a> enjoyed unparalleled popularity among viewers with a working knowledge of grocery prices and far beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>The nostalgia-inducing game show calls on contestants to answer trivia questions and fill their carts with the most expensive items they can lay their eyes on. But it wasn't the edgy sweaters or host Leslie Jones's hilarious jokes that keep viewers preoccupied. Many would like to know: Where was the show filmed?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Supermarket Sweep' was filmed at a shop specifically built for this purpose.</h2><p>According to a recent press release by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a>, the latest iteration of the eminent game show was filmed on a set designed specifically for this purpose. Unlike in previous years, the current season of Supermarket Sweep was shot at a shop-like setting where perishable and non-perishable goods, electric gadgets, and various other, equally eccentric items were arranged in such a way as to make the contestants' job all the more complicated.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The latest episodes of Supermarket Sweep were shot inside a 35,000-square-foot hangar that belongs to the Santa Monica Municipal Airport<strong> </strong>in Santa Monica, Calif., a previous article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a><strong> </strong>reveals. The filming of the show was supposed to begin in the spring of 2020 — but it was pushed back to the end of July 2020 due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, the set has changed dramatically by then, as producers had to make sure that the contestants would be able to adhere to social distancing at all times and that touching the consumer goods on set wouldn't put them at risk of contracting the virus.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, the coronavirus protocol extends far beyond the set layout and the rigorous use of electrostatic sprayers. As producer Wes Kauble told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, everyone on set had to wear masks and personal protective equipment when they were off-camera.&nbsp;</p><p>"The only people who ever had their masks off were anyone who actually appeared on camera, and they only took them off when the cameras were rolling. Everyone else had to have masks, PPE, et cetera, everything you can imagine," he told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>"We made the conscious decision to shoot it that way, because we wanted people to be able to have a departure and a vacation from what’s been going on. Seeing people running around a supermarket in masks felt a little too real," he added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The new version stars Leslie Jones in place of original 'Supermarket Sweep' host David Ruprecht.</h2><p>Other changes have taken place over at Supermarket Sweep as well. SNL alum and Emmy Award-nominated actress<strong> </strong>Leslie Jones came to replace <a href=#>the legendary David Ruprecht,</a> who hosted the show during the 1990s and early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>The creators of the latest iteration of the show made conscious efforts to ensure that no items would go to waste. According to a previous article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, they donated 95 pallets of food products to local charities, including The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank,<strong> </strong>Food Finders,<strong> </strong>FoodCycle LA,<strong> </strong>Los Angeles Mission,<strong> </strong>Downtown Women's Center, among others. They also gifted meats and pet food to organizations like the Rancho Wildlife Foundation and The Rescue Train.</p><p>Catch new episodes of<strong> </strong>Supermarket Sweep<strong> </strong>every Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlo6q9pr7MmqmknaRiwLixxKlkn6GcorKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./322817-afueni-kwa-jamaa-ambaye-noti-zake-zilichomeka-benki-yakubali-kubadilisha-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Afueni kwa jamaa ambaye noti zake zilichomeka, benki kuu yakubali kubadilisha</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./burn-boy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Burna Boy On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
