This posed a challenge for motorists and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>commuters</strong></a> resuming their daily activities after the weekend break.</p><p>Heavy traffic is also witnessed along the Lekki-Epe Expressway, including Sangotedo and Victoria Garden City (VGC) axis.</p><p>On the Island (Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Obalende axis), only a few stations had supplied with manageable queues. It was the same situation along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.</p><p>Some commuters resorted to trekking long distances to get to their destinations, while commercial transporters took advantage of the situation to hike transport fares on busy routes. The fare from Ajah to CMS, which, ordinarily, was N400, was hiked to ₦1,000.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the stations have resolved to attend only to customers buying in jerry cans for the black market business.</p><p>Reports made available by The Guardian revealed that there were no queues at filling stations in Mushin, Isolo, Ejigbo, Ikotun and environs.</p><p>Reports earlier had claimed that petrol scarcity currently being experienced in Lagos is due to the current effort by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to recall harmful imported petroleum products.</p><p>According to sources, most of the petrol imported into the country under the Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP) contract has a high content of methanol and ethanol, which are outside the official specification of Nigeria’s petrol. “This product is highly harmful to the market,” The Guardian quoted a source as saying.</p><p>A senior official in the downstream sector, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the development, adding that NNPC is currently doing a product tracing to contain the harmful implication in the market.</p><p>“Nigeria should not be doing business with companies with a bad reputation in the market. The implication is very cruel on the consumers of these products, most especially Lagosians,” he stated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49xZqCqmZm5sK%2FKZqCnZZmgvLq1jJucq5%2BVp3qtscqkoGanpJ2ys7%2BMmqpmnqWauW6%2FwpqpnKGkrnqptdOsZKWZl6TAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-faist-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Faist - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cbn-increases-currency-in-circulation-by-e2-82-a6418bn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CBN Increases Currency In Circulation By 418bn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
