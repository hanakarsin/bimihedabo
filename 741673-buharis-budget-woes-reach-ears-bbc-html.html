Out he marched in late December, superintendent straight, stern-faced, to present Nigeria's 2016 budget to the National Assembly.</p><p>With great fanfare, the Senate received the boxed document, gave a resounding round of applause, and even got the man at the top to crack a grin.</p><p>It was an occasion worth celebrating, indeed.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: &nbsp;Troops deal Boko Haram terrorists fatal blow, rescue 150</strong></p><p>The first time in as long as anyone can remember when the country's annual budget was ready before the middle of the year.</p><p>It was also the first in three years that a Nigerian president had personally presented a budget to the National Assembly.</p><p>Former President Goodluck Jonathan usually dispatched his finance minister to perform the duty.</p><p>In addition, the budget was mad available online&nbsp;for citizens who so wished to freely scrutinise.</p><p><strong>The disappearing budget act</strong></p><p>Who says Nigeria is not progressive?</p><p>Having thus made history, President Buhari exited the stage to go and continue chasing after the men and women who have been accused of spending the past few years stuffing their bellies full with funds meant for the war against Boko Haram militants.</p><p>With each new day, his trawl seems to drag in a new high-profile culprit. What a true brotherhood the multitude of alleged thieves must have shared.</p><p>There was a brief subplot when the budget went missing&nbsp;from the National Assembly, when no-one could trace the document presented by the head of state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5ivv0mf6fjj.jpeg><p>But that matter was quickly resolved and a fresh document found its way from the State House to the senators.</p><p>Once again, all was well with the world.</p><p>So what if there were some slight differences between the original document which disappeared and the new one? The show had to go on.</p><p>In a detailed analysis, Premium Times&nbsp;excavated some alarming figures from the budget, showing for example that the total amount budgeted for the State House clinic which serves just a few people, far exceeds that for some of the country's major hospitals which serve millions.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: &nbsp;Forty visible achievements of President Buhari - CAN</strong></p><p>In addition, the amount budgeted for books for the vice-president's office far exceeds that for some of the country's major universities.</p><p>Yes, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is a professor of law. We know the learned folk like to read, but still.</p><p>On and on the alarming discoveries continued.</p><p>None of this was in keeping with the president's well-publicised austere nature.</p><p><strong>N10 billion smuggled away</strong></p><p>Even the presidency appeared speechless and confused.</p><p>The office was still struggling to understand the situation when the government ministers took the stage.</p><p>Next thing, the Senate discovered a questionable sum of 10bn naira smuggled into the budget of the ministry of education.</p><p>Then health minster Isaac Adewole expressed shock at the figures for his ministry, which he was expected to defend in parliament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5s3j9350q5v.jpeg><p><i>"This was not what we submitted,"</i> he said.</p><p><i>"We'll submit another one."</i></p><p>With that, the mystery of the State House budget was solved.</p><p>Apparently, while President Buhari was busy poking alleged looters out of their holes, a budget mafia, in the words of an unnamed presidency source and thought to refer to some civil servants - had padded out his budget with a few billion naira, which he knew nothing about.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: &nbsp;Buhari appoints new executive secretary and board for NETI</strong></p><p>Like most good dramas, the budget fiasco is not only about entertainment.</p><p>It has a moral at the end. The director of the budget office has been sacked.</p><p>And thanks to this tale of bloated figures and discrepancies, President Buhari now knows that his famous war on corruption must extend beyond big names and past governments.</p><p>The looters are within his camp as well as without.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DETAILS AT BBC</a></strong></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHV9lXBqZpqlna6ztdJmma6cl5rBbsPOnqpmqpWWsKl5xJqprGWSl7BvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./booka-600-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Booka 600 - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-why-we-havent-unveiled-presidential-campaign-council-lp.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023: Why We Haven't Unveiled Presidential Campaign Council</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
