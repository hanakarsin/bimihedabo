(<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tasya later claimed</a> that "Amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a power position" and that "charges were quickly dropped.")</p><p>In November 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> spoke with Amber Heard about what it was like filming with Johnny; she had nothing but nice things to say about the experience, admitting that "it was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something."</p><p>Although the two were dating other people at the time of filming — Johnny was with his long-time partner <a href=#>Vanessa Paradis</a>, and Amber was dating Tasya — that didn't stop them from developing intense chemistry.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Early 2012: Johnny and Amber begin dating.</h2><p>After 14 years together, Johnny and Vanessa split in 2012.

Because they both have it, when these two energies come together or commit to a relationship, they are going to kind of take on this really forceful and destructive nature."</p><p>Lisa noted that it's "rare" for "two people to find each other in this world who have [caput algol]."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">January 2014: Amber is photographed wearing an engagement ring.</h2><p>In January 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that Johnny and Amber were engaged after photos emerged of the actress attempting to hide the elegant engagement ring on her left hand.
