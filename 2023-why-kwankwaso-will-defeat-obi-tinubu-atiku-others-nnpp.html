We in the national working committee consider these reports as the handiwork of fifth columnists, who have been trying to cause disaffection in the party and they will never succeed.</p><p>“They had tried in the past to plant such discord that our Presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, was going to step down for another presidential candidate. Since that couldn’t fly, they have resorted to planting sundry stories against the party.</p><p>“As a political party, our mission and vision and that of our presidential candidate is very clear. That mission and vision is to win the presidential election next year and to take the country out of the woods, which it has been in the last seven years.</p><p>“The meritorious and distinguished credentials of our Presidential Candidate, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, in public service and all the political offices that he held are indisputable and no one can fault them.</p><p>“We do sincerely understand that it is the tree with the ripe fruits that attracts the attention of the people, the reason for the barrage of attacks against our party and its presidential candidate.</p><p>“However, we are moving, as the party is working in harmony and unity of purpose for what it’s doing.</p><p>“We remain focused and would not allow anybody to distract us by sowing seeds of disaffection in the party. NNPP remains the fastest growing party in the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49sZmtoYmh6uLTYZqKwmZ6gxKK%2FzmauoqScYrGmssSaq2ankp56tbXNrpmuZZGptqzBjKiroZ2iqHqvus%2BpZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elsie-silver-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elsie Silver - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zendaya-coleman-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zendaya - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
