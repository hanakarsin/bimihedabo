Six years later, Spector was found guilty after a retrial and was sentenced to 19 years to life. Is he still in prison, or did his vast fortune save the day? Let's take a look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Phil Spector?</h2><p>On Jan. 16, 2021, it was reported the Spector passed away at the age of 81 from natural causes, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>. It was later determined that the songwriter and convicted killer had died from complications related to COVID-19. Spector's daughter Audrey Spector told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> that she saw her father the day before he died, and said he "appeared to be suffering."</p><p>Spector was not alone at San Joaquin General Hospital, where he spent his last days. Audrey told the outlet that he "died with love and dignity." She blamed the hospital for her father's death, claiming they neglected him and treated him cruelly.</p><p>Days before he was admitted, she spoke with Spector on the phone and noted he was "experiencing severe wheezing, could not get through a sentence without coughing, could not swallow or eat." She said he was begging for medical help.</p><p>After Spector's death, his ex-wife Ronnie Spector <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about him on Instagram</a>. It was a shockingly respectful statement given the fact that she alleges he was abusive in their marriage. She praised his genius and the beautiful music they created together. "As I said many times while he was alive, he was a brilliant producer, but a lousy husband," she wrote. "Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio. Darkness set in, many lives were damaged."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSpoJmherS8xJyrqKo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1076988-6-pictures-trumps-presidential-jet-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 pictures of inside Trump's presidential jet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./man-stung-by-bees-while-sleeping-with-another-mans-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man Stung By Bees While Fornicating With Another Man's Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
