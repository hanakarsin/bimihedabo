He was, however, arrested by operatives of the EFCC on August 12, 2020, and subsequently arraigned on December 4, 2020, <strong>Naija News</strong> report.</p><p>Iweregbu is said to have pleaded “guilty” to the charges against him, prompting the prosecuting counsel, Franklyn Ofoma, to urge the court to sentence and convict him accordingly.</p><p>On his part, in his review of the facts against the defendant, Ofoma told the court that “an investigation of the FBI intelligence report given to the EFCC revealed that he was into an online romance scam.”</p><p>He added, “He normally disguised as Captain Larry Pham to defraud his victims, who are mostly females.</p><p>“When he was arrested by the EFCC, he admitted his role in engaging in an internet scam.”</p><p>Ofoma further revealed that forensic analysis of the suspect’s mobile device and PC revealed indicting documents and other evidence, which he used to perpetrate the $15,000 fraud. Thereafter, Ofoma presented in evidence the documents printed by the EFCC from his mobile phone and computer, the statement he made in the EFCC custody as well as the intelligence report of the FBI, all of which were admitted as exhibits.</p><p>Meanwhile, the defence counsel, Z.S. Makinde had pleaded with the Court to temper justice with mercy, as the convict did not waste the time of the Court and was a first-time offender.</p><p>He said, “He is a father of two and his wife just gave birth. He has also shown remorse, and at the time the offence was committed, he, indeed, wanted to marry the white lady.”</p><p>On his part, while delivering the judgement following hearings from both sides, Justice Taiwo sentenced Iweregbu to 18 months in prison on each of the three counts to run concurrently, with an option of fine of N100, 000.00 on each count. He also granted the application of the prosecution to forfeit the iPhone and laptop recovered from him to the Federal Government.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the Court of Appeal in Abuja dismissed the case filed by&nbsp;Maryam Sanda&nbsp;for lack of evidence.</strong></a></p><p>The court reiterated the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>verdict of an Abuja High Court</strong></a>, which sentenced her to death by hanging for the murder of her husband, Bilyaminu Bello.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49wZpynpafBbr%2FEp6ueppOaeq6tzWarqGVhbXquu82tn6xlmaN6sb7IrKanZZ%2BrsrN50aikmqaTmnq0r8CmZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./facts-to-note-about-the-newly-elected-pdp-national-chairman-iyorchia-ayu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Facts To Note About The Newly Elected PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kid-cudi-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kid Cudi - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
