His stand is clear: ‘Val, to me, education is the progressive discovery of our ignorance. We learn every day. The possession of paper qualification is not, and cannot become the measure of wisdom and intelligence.</p><p>“When people debate what I graduated with, ignore them. To allow yourself to become fixated on such inane discourse is to imply that you do not have better things to do.</p><p>“But I have always had a different view. Simple publication, not for the sake of debate, but to clear all doubts, especially among those that are deceived.</p><p>“Yesterday, though INEC included ‘Degree’ to his qualifications, without specifying the field, mischief makers went to town. Some of them even went to the extent of implying that either he did not attend university after all or he did not graduate.</p><p>“He remains the most probed and searched Nigerian. They wish they could detect faults in him as a mark of respect for the frailty of human nature.</p><p>“At this point, there is no need to confer with him. I had to reach our boss immediately, Mr Oseloka Obaze. Hear him: ‘Val, go on and publish. If anything arises, tell him that I authorized. We need not appease mischief makers, but to clear all doubts among all men and women of goodwill who are genuinely concerned.”</p><h2>Other Candidates Should Publish Their Qualifications Too</h2><p>The media aide also threw a shade at the presidential candidates whose academic qualifications are shrouded in controversy, urging such people to come public with their qualifications just as Obi has done.</p><p>He added;&nbsp;“Also attached are his credentials as published by INEC. Having published the result, let others whose credentials are doubted publish theirs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FqZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KewG6vwKanZqqVobKiv8SsZJ6umZmyr6%2FEZqanZZiewG7BzaKtnqqjnsG6ecOenqudlWKup8DEq2SippWYerHBwaWgnJmknryvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./transfer-update-on-osimhen-greenwood-wan-bissaka-benzema-danjuma-others.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Transfer Update On Osimhen, Greenwood, Wan-Bissaka, Benzema, Danjuma, Others</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./park-soo-young-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Park Soo-young - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
