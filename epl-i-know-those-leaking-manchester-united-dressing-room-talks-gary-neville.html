However, there has been turbulence recently over his reign at the club.</p><p>One of the disturbing issues at the club presently is leaking out of information by some persons. Among the leaks from the United dressing room is that the squad prefers Paris Saint-Germain manager, <strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong> to be the permanent appointment this summer.</p><p>Disturbed just like other pundits and stakeholders of the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Premier League</strong></a> club, Neville who was a former defender for the Red Devils said he knows those players and their representatives behind the leaks.</p><p>Speaking on his Gary Neville podcast on Sunday, the pundit said: “I remember when I joined Sky and we had the Champions League in the early years, and I went over to Napoli to do a game involving Chelsea.</p><p>“It was when Andre Villas-Boas was their manager and he left out Frank Lampard, Michael Essien, Ashley Cole – four or five prominent players.</p><p>“That is what managers tend to do in their final days at a club, as they see it as a free hit.</p><p>“I remember sitting there at lunchtime with our team and they were getting messages of team news being leaked and the manager being slagged off, and I sat there thinking ‘does this actually happen’?</p><p><strong>“Players agents and PR teams</strong> were briefing the media on a matchday about what was going on inside a club, and it was the first time I had seen it and known for it to happen – it really unnerved me.”</p><p>“That is happening at Manchester United now. They are at it, the PR teams, the agents and the marketing teams, as self-preservation for their own player,” Neville stressed.</p><p>He added: “But what they do not realise is that unfortunately, when they go to the media then those media people go to us – so we know who is briefing.</p><p>“The reality is that we do not like it, but we know who it is.</p><p>“We are not going to throw people under a bus here because we have that journalistic respect – but they are it in the same way that Chelsea were all those years ago.</p><p>“They need to stop it and work as hard as they can.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BtZp6onGK2brfNqK5mrJikwKZ5y56YpKGenHqurc2cn56rpJq%2FbsHNoquenF2Zv6a%2F0qKloGWipLyuedOao6SrXZyus8WMp5yvoZyhsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nadine-njeim-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nadine Nassib Njeim - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1076988-6-pictures-trumps-presidential-jet-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6 pictures of inside Trump's presidential jet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
