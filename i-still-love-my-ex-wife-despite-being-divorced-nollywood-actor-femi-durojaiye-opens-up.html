Some people have given up on love, marriage and relationships. But, that is so wrong. Love is still a beautiful thing and the most important thing God created. I envy anyone who is in love.</p><p>“I still love my ex-wife, because she was my friend for about 18 years before we got married. We were teenage lovers. She was 16 and I was 17. Our divorce was not acrimonious. It just did not work out anymore, so we went our separate ways. We have children between us and we are friends. If I don’t tell you that we are divorced, you won’t ever know when you see her around me, because we were best friends.</p><p>&nbsp;“I am not sure yet, because of work. However, if I have to take anyone out on Valentine’s Day, it would be her.</p><p>“Never marry anybody for any other reason than for the fact that you love the person. Don’t marry because she is a church girl, or because he is a mosque man. If you make the mistake of marrying the wrong person, eight times out of 10, that marriage will not work. Love is so important.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BpZqJlo6m2rbiMpaavnV2ixm6x12auop6VYrGmv8%2Biq55lkpq2r7OMnaCvp6KYsqV5zaijpbGnpLylecCcq6iqXZuyrrWMnayrp5qWtrqxjKinnqajYsKxew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1236184-50-wrist-tattoos-ideas-men-women-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 wrist tattoos ideas for men and women</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-does-colton-end-up-with-the-bachelor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Does Colton Underwood End up With?
