They were surprised and I saw the coach (Peseiro) on Sunday after the final and he came to me and said, ‘You did it very well against us, you were more a threat than Ivory Coast, it was for us a surprise the way you played,” Broos told Marawa Sports Worldwide.</p><p>He added, “So, this is what I want with them and when you can do that because this is a team with great potential and let’s hope that we can succeed every time playing like this”.</p><p>The Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Bafana Bafana of South Africa will meet on June 3, 2024, for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers. The two countries have played two games each in the World Cup, in which Nigeria recorded two draws while South Africa recorded a win and a defeat.</p><p>When asked if South Africa can qualify for the 2026 World Cup, Broos said, “Yes, and maybe not sure as yet, but I believe we have a very big chance to be at the World Cup in 2026, we can make it”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BuZqynpam1bq3Fq6CcmV2YvKKvx2apnq6Vlrm0edahmK1lmqTApnnPnqqeoaKkerW7y51koaGdYq6nwMSrZGtoYmh6orLCqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fiona-dourif-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fiona Dourif - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./police-arraign-41-suspected-illegal-miners-in-ibadan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Police Arraign 41 Suspected Illegal Miners In Ibadan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
