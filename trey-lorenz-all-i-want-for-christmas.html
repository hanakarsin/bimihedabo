He's a backup singer for Mariah who was featured on "All I Want for Christmas."</h2><p>Trey started his music career as a backup vocalist for Mariah. That's right, his first gig was with her — imagine getting your start with someone as famous as Mariah Carey.</p><p>He was a supporting vocalist for one of her first tours back in 1990, but she continued to bring him on as a backup. He recorded her album Emotions with her as a backup singer and continued to follow her on other albums and live appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From there, Mariah asked him to do duets with her, including the Jackson 5's "I'll Be There" for Michael Jackson's memorial service. That duet was released as a single, and managed to top the charts in the U.S. at number one, opening doors for Trey's solo career.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He then released his own self-titled album.</h2><p>The success of the duet led to Trey being signed by a label for his own album. With the help of Mariah, who co-wrote some of the songs and also performed backup vocals for him, Trey's album Trey Lorenz was released in 1992.</p><p>The single off the album, "Someone to Hold," performed really well, peaking at No. 19 and No. 5 on the pop and R&B charts, respectfully.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But, unfortunately, the single performed significantly better than the album, which was consistently low on the charts. his label declared it a flop, and subsequently dropped him.</p><p>After that, Trey went on to continue doing backup vocals for other artists, like Selena and Usher, while continuing to support Mariah on her tours and albums. And yes, he is featured as a backup vocalist on her famous Christmas anthem "All I Want for Christmas."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trey will make an appearance in Mariah's new documentary.</h2><p>Ahead of the 25th anniversary of the hit Christmas single, Amazon is releasing a documentary about the making of the song, featuring everyone close to Mariah who was involved in its creation.
