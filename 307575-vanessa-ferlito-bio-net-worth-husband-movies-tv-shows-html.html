The announcement came as a shock for many, especially from fans of the TV show. In one of the interviews with TV Guide, she cast down any possibility of her ever getting fired by the directors of the show. She cited that she had no intention of being part of an hour-long TV show. "I had no intention of doing an hour TV show. I had just wrapped the movie Man of the House with Tommy Lee Jones, so it's not like I had nothing going on."</p><p class=align-left>Despite being never keen on the idea of being part of a TV show, she still accepted the offer by the NY producers to be part of CS: New York. According to her, she thought it was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great opportunity at first</a>, but later she was no longer into the TV show idea. However, despite speculations that there was brushing shoulders with the directors and producers of the show, she said that being part of CSI: NY was a great experience. She still insists that she wants to do more movies as opposed to TV shows due to reasons only known to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62126fac77d8ffb1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nikki Perkins bio: Age, ethnicity, Jamie break-up, siblings, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is the second time that Ferlito has left a TV show to do a movie instead.

She went to take part in the movie Man in the House. According to Ferlito, leaving "CSI: NY" was creating a space and opportunity for herself.

The online community had her pictures before and after college all over social media in support of the allegation. However, she cited that the gossip brought her more attention and fame instead. The ab initio Vanessa would not even consider responding to such claims. Her reaction would be judged otherwise. But until she gives a response to these online rumours, we cannot conclude the surgery.

Conversely, others have showered praises on her citing that the lip augmentation was indeed one of the best surgery procedures done to perfection.</p><h2>How much is Vanessa Ferlito net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Vanessa's acting career dates back to the 90s and since then has featured in numerous TV shows and movies.
