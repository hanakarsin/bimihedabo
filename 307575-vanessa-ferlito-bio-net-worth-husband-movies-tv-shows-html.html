I had just wrapped the movie Man of the House with Tommy Lee Jones, so it's not like I had nothing going on."</p><p class=align-left>Despite being never keen on the idea of being part of a TV show, she still accepted the offer by the NY producers to be part of CS: New York. According to her, she thought it was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great opportunity at first</a>, but later she was no longer into the TV show idea. However, despite speculations that there was brushing shoulders with the directors and producers of the show, she said that being part of CSI: NY was a great experience. She still insists that she wants to do more movies as opposed to TV shows due to reasons only known to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62126fac77d8ffb1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nikki Perkins bio: Age, ethnicity, Jamie break-up, siblings, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is the second time that Ferlito has left a TV show to do a movie instead.

She went to take part in the movie Man in the House. According to Ferlito, leaving "CSI: NY" was creating a space and opportunity for herself.

Conversely, others have showered praises on her citing that the lip augmentation was indeed one of the best surgery procedures done to perfection.</p><h2>How much is Vanessa Ferlito net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Vanessa's acting career dates back to the 90s and since then has featured in numerous TV shows and movies.
