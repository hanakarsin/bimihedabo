Activities of those groups increase poverty and reduce access to education and therefore create an even poorer and less educative society for the future. If any kind of group can target educational institutions for the sole purpose of discouraging people from getting education, it tells you how far we have sunk and it tells you the kind of emergency that we face in the North because it is nothing short of a vicious cycle”</i> he said.</p><p>The former Central Bank of Nigeria governor further stated that the menace of Boko Haram has been ignored for too long saying; <i>“it can no longer be ignored.”</i></p><p>According to him, Boko Haram which started in 2001 has now grown into a real monster. Although he agreed there is a military solution to it, he however, insisted on re-orientation, enlightenment and awareness on the importance of education on the country’s younger generation.</p><p><i>“So for me, I have assumed this role at a time of great difficulty, when we are facing challenges, and I will like to first of all request all Kings College boys and all friends to come to our aid with any kind of support, ideas, analysis or recommendations on how we can confront this menace. Not just the security aspect, but also the entire mindset because it has set the North back probably by half a century”</i> the Emir said.</p><p>Sanusi urged all members of KCOBA to try and get into the public sector in order to show good leadership quality. He said some people are convinced that there is something wrong with the country’s education system as some believe that education no longer has value.</p><p>According to him, many of the so-called educated Nigerians have not been a very good example on what education should do, and urged those that came out of Kings College go into public service system.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Troops Repel Boko Haram In Konduga, Kill Scores</a></p><p><i>“Too many Kings College boys are so much into private organisations, clinics, engineering firms and private businesses; there are not enough of us in the public service. Nigeria needs Kings College. Make this a major point for the future young boys coming out and those outside. Let us find our way into the public sector and provide the country the kind of leadership we were brought up with,”</i> he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Nigerian soldier who is fighting against the insurgents in Borno state has said the Boko Haram war is <a href=#>a political one, not a tribal or reli­gious war and a popular politician from Borno is truly one of their sponsors.</a></p><p>According to the Nigerian Defence Headquarters Boko Haram members have started surrendering themselves <a href=#>voluntarily in Konduga town, Konduga LGA of Borno State,</a> while President Goodluck Jonathan had <a href=#>also assured that the menace of the terrorist group will end by next month.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3qAmG9rZpqfoLxutMCrmKZmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-foreman-sexual-abuse-allegations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Foreman Denies Sexual Abuse Allegations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./police-kill-two-cult-leaders-in-rivers-recover-arms.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Police Kill Two Cult Leaders In Rivers, Recover arms</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
