presidential candidate of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</a>, Atiku Abubakar, may be actively seeking reconciliation with aggrieved governors of his party.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the aggrieved governors, known as the G5 governors, include Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.</p><p>Recall that both camps have recently expressed intentions to reconcile, but the Wike camp has insisted on the removal or resignation of the PDP National Chairman, <strong>Dr. Iyorchia Ayu</strong>.</p><p>According to sources close to the Wike’s camp, Atiku, due to events of the past few weeks, has realized he cannot run the election alone without the help of Wike, Ortom, Makinde, and others.</p><p>According to multiple sources who spoke to Daily Post, a gang up of southern governors, who are also Christians, could work in favour of Atiku, who is hoping that the North would interpret it as such.</p><p>Also, the Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed’s decision to join the five aggrieved governors opposed to him may have prompted the PDP presidential candidate to consider reconciliation.</p><p>It was gathered that Atiku was shocked by Mohammed’s comments, which according to those close to him, may affect the northern bloc votes he was hoping for.</p><p>Although Governor Mohammed advised the G-5 governors to refrain from making their rift with Atiku a religious one, a reconciliation with Atiku may make the aggrieved governors look weak if Ayu remains the party chairman.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rising profile of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, especially in the South-south, is reportedly giving the PDP headache.</p><p>Peter Obi has been able to hold down the South-south region, which was traditionally a PDP stronghold.</p><p>It was gathered that the Atiku’s camp had speculated that Peter Obi’s momentum might die off soon, but that has not been the case.</p><h2>“I Thought They Were More Serious” – Obaseki Reveals Why He Denied Peter Obi Use Of Ogbemudia Stadium For Campaign</h2><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki</a></strong> has defended the decision of his government not to allow Peter Obi and his party supporters to use the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium for their campaign on Friday.</p><p>The Governor explained that the request for the use of the stadium came too late as there were certain procedures and precautions that needed to be followed if the facility would be used for such an event.</p><p>He added that he thought Obi and his team were more serious but was disappointed that they were just submitting their application for the use of the stadium about twenty-four hours before the event’s kick-off.</p><p>Obaseki added that Obi informed him of his plans to visit Edo but didn’t state he was coming for a campaign rally.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong>&nbsp;understands Obi, and his party&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>held their campaign rally</a></strong>&nbsp;in Edo State on Friday at the Baptist Convention Ground Oliha Quarters, TV Road Benin City, after they were denied the use of other government facilities as claimed by the Labour Party publicity secretary in the state,&nbsp;<strong>Comr. Sam Oroupa</strong>.</p><p>The development attracted a lot of condemnation for Obaseki, with many Nigerians taking to social media to knock the Edo governor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BrZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KewG6%2F1KueoqaXYr2wvNSlmKuhpK56o63LmmSmp5iZeqWxwqKqoqeeYsGwecmooKdlp564pr%2BMnJimqF2nrrXAy56qZpmknri2ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./70616-uhuru-kenyatta-attends-pope-francis-youth-event-at-kasarani-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pope Francis Speaks About Corruption And Tribalism</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kacey-musgraves-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kacey Musgraves - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
