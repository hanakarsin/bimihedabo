At the time, she was dating <a href=#>Calvin Harris</a> — but she would leave the Met Gala two days later with Tom Hiddleston, the <a href=#>infamous affair</a> referred to in "Getaway Car" from "Reputation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On the night of April 28, Taylor was spotted leaving Gigi Hadid's birthday party. The next day, an interview between Calvin and Ryan Seacrest went live following the release of his hit single "This Is What You Came For."</p><p>Though Taylor's alias Nils Sjoberg is credited as a co-writer on the song, Calvin lied in the interview when asked if he would collaborate with Taylor.</p><p>“You know, we haven’t even spoken about it. I can’t see it happening, though,” he said. “No. She’s about to take a long break.”</p><p>This interview was later rumored to be a point of contention in their relationship. It's long been suspected that Taylor was less than faithful to Calvin in the final days of their romance, and "High Infidelity" seems to confirm that she may have cheated on her ex-boyfriend following this interview — though if the lyrics are any indication, she doesn't feel a lot of remorse about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIywmKxlkaW%2FqriMa3BmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-bell-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Drake Bell's Wife?
