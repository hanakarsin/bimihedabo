Among these luminaries is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Newton</a>, known for his charming portrayal of <a href=#>Colin Bridgerton</a> in the hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> series <a href=#>Bridgerton</a>, which has catapulted him into fame and sparked curiosity about his off-screen romances.</p><p>With a fan base eager to know every detail of his life, Luke's dating history has become a topic of fascination. From rumored liaisons to confirmed relationships, every new piece of information adds another layer to the public persona of this rising star. But, who has he dated? Keep reading for all of the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Luke Newton's dating history?</h2><p>Before Luke was known for his role in Bridgerton, he was well-known as a Disney star. He played in a Disney UL series called The Lodge. This is also where he met <a href=#>Sophie Simnett</a>, whom he dated from 2016‚Äì2018. Sophie also played a major role in the show, but since both Luke and Sophie weren't big names back in the day, there wasn't any sort of social or public commentary on why their relationship ended.</p><p>Luke dated Jade Davies from 2019 to 2023. The two met shortly before the filming of Bridgerton started and their relationship ended shortly after Season 3 of the show. However, it's uncertain if the end of their relationship had anything to do with Luke's role on the show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, "Luke and Jade drifted apart as they could not find time in their busy schedules to invest in their relationship.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Newton (@lukenewtonuk)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Luke Newton dating now?</h2><p>As the anticipation began building around Bridgerton Season 3, where the evolving romance between <a href=#>Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington</a>, portrayed by <a href=#>Nicola Coughlan</a>, takes center stage, the curiosity around Luke's real-life romantic connections intensified. It appears that Luke values his privacy, particularly when it comes to his love life, making it a bit more difficult to determine if he has a girlfriend.</p><p>Nevertheless, as he continues to become more widely known (and popular), it becomes increasingly challenging for him to keep his romantic life private. Despite his social media profiles showing no traces of romantic partners, past or present, he couldn't avoid the cameras in June 2024 when he was spotted with dancer Antonia Roumelioti, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. The pair was captured together after the Netflix series' midseason premiere held in London.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Antonia Roumelioti (@antoniaroumelioti_)</a></p></figure><p>Neither Luke nor Antonia have confirmed whether they are actually dating or just having a good time, though rumors of their relationship date back to May 2024. Regardless of his relationship status, Luke remains a fervent supporter of his character's quest for love on Bridgerton.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ME ON THURSDAY WHEN I SEE COLIN BRIDGERTON FINALLY KISS PENELOPE FEATHERINGTON <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ru6LRZIEbp</a></p>‚Äî üêùPromenading Anthony‚Äôs Pinnacleüêù (@chaoticguitar) <a href=#>May 12, 2024</a></figure><p>In an enlightening March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shondaland</a>, Luke expressed his admiration for the unique dynamic between Colin and Penelope. "Their relationship is [has] been a real slow burn.

"But what I love about Colin and Penelope is the longevity of the relationship and how long it‚Äôs taken to get to even where it is now, which is not even considered a relationship.
