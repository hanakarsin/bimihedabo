Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light, and shadows."</p><p>He continues, "Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery – celebrate it if you feel like it."</p><p>It's hard to argue that there is a truly "original" work of art, but that doesn't necessarily mean that art is "bad."</p><p>For example, none of Shakespeare's plays, save for The Tempest featured an original plot: all of them were lifted from other literary traditions and sources. What Billy Shakes did with the OG material, however, like adding in iambic pentameter and a bunch of scatological jokes.</p><p>But where things start to get complicated is when said art is sold for profit, and when artists accuse major production companies of stealing their work.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@monstercaesarstudios href=#>@monstercaesarstudios</a><p>Disney Stole and is selling my work @disneyparks <a title=stolenart href=#>#stolenart</a> <a title=artistontiktok href=#>#artistontiktok</a> <a title=disney href=#>#disney</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Andrew Martin - Sculptor" href=#>♬ original sound - Andrew Martin - Sculptor</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>This is what Andrew Martin of, who uploads TikToks under the username <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@monstercaesarstudios</a> said that he saw one of his designs for sale at Disney World.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>Here's what went down according to Andrew: he uploaded one of his designs on Thingiverse, which is a 3D-printing design platform where folks upload their model schematics for others to enjoy and even make for themselves on their own 3D printers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>He did this way back in 2018, and Andrew's alleging now that Disney is using the character model in its Enchanted Tiki Room section in its parks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>"It did look a lot like mine because it is mine.

Andrew's design was one that was created under a Creative Commons License, meaning he could create models based off of Disney's intellectual properties as long as he didn't sell them for profit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>Andrew suspects that a freelancer who was hired to design the merchandise probably saw his model on the 3D-printing model website and just copied it: "So the most likely thing is the thief was some lazy waste of skin, talentless hack, that got himself or herself an easy payday by stealing my work and passing it off as their own."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @monstercaesarstudio</span></figure><p>There were some people who said that Andrew doesn't really have a reason to be upset, since his design was inspired by Disney, while others thought that his artwork was different enough to constitute as an original piece of art.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0usSyZKyslZa5tHnSnKylqKSkv7R51qippA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./631460-robbed-south-africa-nigerian-beauty-queen-photos-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Nigerian Beauty Queen was Robbed In South Africa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-sitting-judges-should-not-preside-over-election-tribunals-afe-babalola.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Sitting Judges Should Not Preside Over Election Tribunals Afe Babalola</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
