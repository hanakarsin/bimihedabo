In the years following, her channel became one of the top 10 most-watched female-led platforms, and she still boasts more than 20 million subscribers even though she has not uploaded content to the channel since June of 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jenna's personal life has changed drastically since the beginning of her career — she's been in a long-term relationship for an eternity by typical Hollywood standards.<a href=#> Who is Jenna Marbles' boyfriend?</a> As it turns out her boyfriend is now actually her fiancé! We have the scoop on how they first met — it's pretty adorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Jenna Marbles' boyfriend? He's actually her fiancé!</h2><p>Though Jenna's original YouTube content was self-deprecating about her personal life, the 33-year-old YouTuber has been dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julien Solomita</a>, who is six years her junior, since 2013.</p><p>Julien is a native of Northern California, and he has an older sister, a younger brother, and three step siblings. He was recruited to play baseball at Chapman University in 2010. A cracked vertebrae injury during his freshman year of college led him to have to give up baseball.</p><p>During his junior year, he began working at an L.A. bar on the weekends, which was how he met Jenna.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"One day, I was working at the bar, and I got to meet this really cute girl who had come in quite a bit. She had a group of friends that she would sit with, and I'd seen her, but I finally got introduced to her. One night she said, 'you know, maybe you should hang out and not work one night," Julien explained in his 2014 "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Draw My Life — Julien Solomita</a>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"So I did," he continued. "I took the night off, and spent it with her and the group of people. It was really nice getting to know her. And then we started really dating."</p><p>"That person was Jenna, and I'm so lucky to have met her. She's such an incredible person," Julien gushed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenna and Julien bought a house together in 2018.</h2><p>Four years after Julien's swoon-worthy story about meeting his girlfriend, Jenna opened up about taking the next step in her relationship with him in the video, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Bought a House</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>In the beginning of the video, Julien and Jenna discussed how they had been saving up to buy their new California home for years, and how they were excited to show it to their fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"This represents a lot for our future," Jenna explained. "To have this ability to continue to work independently on our podcast and our Twitch stream, and our radio show, we can continue to have an area in our home where we can work, which is a choice. A lot of people sign with companies that do all of these things for them, [but] we have chosen to be as independent as possible, which presents a lot of challenges — a lot of time and effort and energy to make all of these things work." &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While buying a house is a big step in a relationship, Jenna and Julien weren't rushing to the altar.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're not married, but we are legally bound by a deed," Jenna joked about co-signing on the house together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">That all changed in 2021 when Julien and Jenna got engaged!</h2><p>During a Twitch stream on Thursday, April 15, 2021, Julien revealed the happy news that <a href=#>he and Jenna are now engaged</a>.
