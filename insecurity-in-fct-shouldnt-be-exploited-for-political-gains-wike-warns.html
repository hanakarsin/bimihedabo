Nobody has come to commend them. All you here security has collapsed,” he complained.</p><p>Wike criticised assertions by certain activists that the demolition of shanties contributed to insecurity in the FCT.</p><p>He stated that distorting government initiatives for political advantages is not a constructive approach.</p><p>Wike urged residents to support the government and refrain from portraying security issues as a daily norm. He emphasised that nobody is pleased with the resurgence of kidnapping in the FCT.</p><p>Wike said, “Nigerians forget easily, and that is why we have always said let’s not play politics with the issue of security.</p><p>“Remember, some time ago, in the last administration, we were told that bandits came to Kuje prison and wrecked havoc. Nobody said there was no Minister of FCT. There was a minister.</p><p>“Nobody talks about FCT being the capital. Remember, there was an administration where terrorists came and burnt the United Nations building here. It was in FCT.</p><p>“Remember, there was an attack to burn the police headquarters. There was a minister.</p><p>“All over the world, we have heard where armed men went to school in cities and shot at will, killing 15 to 16 people in the United States, in Britain, as developed as they are.</p><p>“That does not mean that the security in those cities has collapsed.”</p><p>Wike appealed to politicians to refrain from exploiting the security situation to instil panic, creating an exaggerated perception that people in the FCT can no longer move freely in the streets without fear of kidnapping.</p><p>The minister encouraged residents to recognise and support government initiatives while providing intelligence information to aid security agencies in addressing the challenges effectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FrZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmoZ5is6TAjKyfqK2cmbu1ecGeZJ6woKG8qsDEnWSfp6JivbC4yK2gnJmcYrSitc2sZLChm5p6uK3Rp6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jubilation-as-banky-w-wins-pdp-ticket-for-eti-osa-federal-constituency-seat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jubilation As Banky W Wins PDP Ticket For Eti-Osa Federal Constituency Seat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alleged-drug-trafficking-full-text-of-nldeas-statement-on-abba-kyari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Full Text Of NLDEA's Statement On Abba Kyari</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
