However, due to the lack of available data on the amount spent by the state on foreign-related trips, it has been excluded from this report.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the states mentioned in this report, such as Zamfara, Jigawa, and Nasarawa, have experienced a lack of foreign investments in the last few months.</p><p>This lack of investment is in line with a broader decline in investments throughout the country, which can be attributed to issues of insecurity and other concerns.</p><p>For example, Zamfara has been heavily affected by banditry in recent years.</p><p>According to a report by PUNCH, banditry has become a prevalent issue in the state, with bandits occupying nearly 14 local government areas. This has resulted in a significant decline in farming activities, as more than 70 per cent of farmlands in the state have been abandoned due to the fear of bandit attacks.</p><p>In 2022, the Managing Director of Zamfara State Investment Cooperation, <strong>Dr. Anas Hamisu Lawal,</strong> highlighted that the state’s insecurity has been a major deterrent to attracting investments.</p><p>Lawal said, “The first question they always ask is the security situation in the state.”</p><p>“They are willing to invest whenever the security situation improves.”</p><h2>They Do Not Have Potential Investors</h2><p>Commenting on the lack of foreign investments in these states, a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akpan Ekpo, recently said to The PUNCH, “They are not importing capital for two reasons. First, they don’t have potential investors who will do that. Secondly, there is insecurity in the country. Those things are not fertile ground for investments.”</p><p>An ECOWAS Common Investment Market consultant, Professor Jonathan Aremu, added, “It’s simple. It’s because they don’t have attractive factors. The factors that attract foreign investment are not available in those states. One thing about investment is that it is crisis shy. Investment doesn’t go to places where there are crises. Why? Because investors want stability and predictability in their investments, particularly, having returns on their investments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BvZp%2BtnKF6rbXSrWRqbF2owaLAxKxkraCRqXq0vMSnm6xlnmd%2Bbq7IpaOip55ivK95xaipnqGXo3q1vsipqmaclai9qsDEZpitrKKWsLW1zaBks52ipHqqutWeqq2llaPBcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ivonne-coll-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ivonne Coll - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-tinubu-atiku-meet-amid-pdps-call-for-apc-presidential-candidate-to-step-down-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubu, Atiku Meet Amid PDP's Call For APC Presidential Candidate To Step Down (Video)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
