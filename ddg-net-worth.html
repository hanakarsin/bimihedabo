Although the rapper deals with a fair share of criticism online, he handles the chatter by trolling folks or simply ignores most of the talk. However, one thing DDG is consistent with is building his audience online with various social channels.</p><p>With that in mind, DDG is known to troll folks online for multiple reasons. Due to his coupledom with Halle, many folks like to run with the narrative that she's the breadwinner in their relationship. As such, DDG frequently posts himself holding wads of cash online. So, folks are wondering how the rapper is doing in the financial department. Here’s what we know about his net worth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">DDG is sitting on a cushy net worth.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, DDG has a net worth of $2 million. This figure directly reflects his work as a rapper, singer-songwriter, and YouTuber. While it isn't common for rappers to step into the YouTuber lane, DDG has been part of the community for years. The site shares that DDG initially began his YouTube journey after dropping out of college. To date, he has created four successful channels: DDG, the DDG Family, PontiacMadeDDG VLOGS, and Zooted Music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Aside from DDG’s YouTube success, he also has a solid music career. DDG earned his first Billboard Hot 100 entry with “Moonwalking in Calabasas” at No. 82, has a gold-certified single, “Arguments,” and has made a plethora of hits with Bluface, Yachty, YG, and more. So, given DDG’s success in multiple lanes, it makes sense that he has a hefty net worth.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>DDG</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Rapper, singer-songwriter, and YouTuber</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> 2,000,000</p><p>DDG is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and YouTuber who is known for being the current boyfriend of Halle Bailey.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Oct. 10, 1997</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Pontiac, Mich.</p><p><strong>Birthname: </strong>Darryl Dwayne Grandberry Jr.</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>One daughter born in 2022</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Central Michigan University</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">DDG posted two tweets about how women should be treated and giving back.</h2><p>It’s quite common for some celebs to share their opinions about relationship dynamics and want to give back to others. So, when DDG took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to share his sentiments about how women should be treated, folks weren’t surprised.</p><p>If you’ve been keeping up with DDG and the hate he gets online, it’s common to hear that he isn't on Halle’s level and he doesn’t know how to treat women. However, some folks believe that a man being able to take care of a woman comes with being financially set. So, when DDG frequently shows off wads of cash online, many people take it as a way to silence the haters.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a Sept 18, 2023, tweet, DDG posted himself holding a wad of cash and tweeting to women how men are supposed to treat them. Of course, the tweet was meant with major pushback about him not showing enough money to digs about him living with Halle.</p><p>In a follow-up tweet, DDG then asked folks to share their cash app tags to possibly donate money to folks in need.</p><p>So, given that DDG is in the giving spirit and has the means to do so, conversations about his finances should be null and void. However, it seems that as long as he dates Halle and makes problematic statements, he will be the subject of backlash online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbGoec2eq2avn6fBqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./400832-kenyans-feel-eacc-punish-kangata-bbi-opinion-tuko-poll-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenyans feel EACC being used to punish Kanga'ta over BBI opinion, TUKO poll</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aiteo-owes-shell-seven-nigerian-banks-1-7bn-report.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aiteo Owes Shell, Seven Nigerian Banks $1.7bn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
