This is with the indiscriminate issuance of conflicting injunctions by courts of equal jurisdiction on the same subject matter.</p><p>This pastime of politicians and conniving judges got so bizarre that the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, summoned the Chief Justices of Rivers, Anambra, Jigawa, Kebbi, Imo, and Cross River States. While the high courts of Imo, Jigawa, and Anambra were reportedly summoned over their roles in the Anambra governorship election, the high courts of Rivers, Kebbi, and Cross River on the other hand are to explain their involvement in the case of the PDP Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus.</p><p>Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and Assembly of Healthcare Professional Association (AHPA) have issued a 15-day strike ultimatum to the Federal Government.</p><p>In a letter addressed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, and other stakeholders on Saturday, JOHESU’s national president, Biobelemonye Josiah said the groups will commence an indefinite strike over outstanding welfare issues with the union.</p><p>He accused the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government of not showing concerns over the plight of its members.</p><p>Former Kano State Governor, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso has alleged that his successor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has refused to pay his pension entitlements for six years, claiming that he is the only one governed Kano State and did not enjoy the benefits.</p><p>He also said the state government did not build a house or an office for him, which is stipulated in a law that every former governor should be provided either an office or a house as part of his benefits.</p><p>Kwankwaso, who made the allegations in an interview with the BBC Hausa service, said it was likely because he was not in the All Progressives Congress (APC) that made the powers-that-be to treat him in that manner.</p><p>Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has accused an unnamed governor in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of instigating the embattled National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, against him.</p><p>Umahi, now in the ruling All Progressives Congress, stated that the governor asked Secondus to set up a disciplinary committee against him.</p><p>Speaking while appearing on Channels Television on Friday, the Ebonyi governor said he knew Secondus will be eventually removed as PDP chairman.</p><p>Less than two years to the inauguration of the next administration in 2023, the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Caretaker Committee headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni has lamented that millions of people who built the party from the scratch are yet to benefit from the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>This was as it blamed some politicians who decamped to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for lacking the kind of patience shown by millions of founding APC members who have never protested their neglect in spite of their loyalty to Buhari from the legacy parties of ANPP, CPC to the APC.</p><p>The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says nothing can stop the Muhammadu Buhari government from regulating social media.</p><p>Mohammed made this known on Saturday during the 64th conference of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), in Sal Island, Cape Verde.</p><p>According to the minister, social media has become a major tool for propagating fake news and a weapon to attack Buhari and government officials.</p><p>The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN), has condemned the murder of Olajide, the younger brother of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, by kidnappers.</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that Sowore had announced that his younger brother was shot dead near Okada town in Edo State on Saturday morning.</p><p>According to the former presidential candidate, Olajide was coming back from school (Igbinedion University), where he is studying Pharmacy</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
