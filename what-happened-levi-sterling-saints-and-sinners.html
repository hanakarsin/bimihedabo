The only good actor in there is Christian Keyes…"</p><p>If you’re wondering what happened with Levi’s story arc and where you can watch Christian next, scroll down for an update on the 43-year-old.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Levi Sterling on Saints & Sinners?</h2><p>In Season 3, Episode 3, the complex character met a tragic end at the hands of Jabari’s wife, Paige. He was murdered after Jabari learned that Levi had signed half of the church over to Ella.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>After he confronted Levi, Jabari found the church’s safe empty except for a note that read, "Just business. Not Personal."</p><p>The next scene showed Levi stopping at a gas station restroom. Paige followed him in and shot him before retrieving a duffle bag full of money from his car. "It’s always personal, Levi," she said as she left the scene of the crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though it’s unclear whether Christian decided to leave the series on his own or if the writers were ready to kill off his character, the Michigan native will always have a special place in his heart for Levi.</p><p>"[He] was originally presented to me as someone with some dirt on his hands. That’s what made it appealing to me," Christian said of the role in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 interview</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I want to have to fight for people to respect the character at times and dislike him at other times … I wanted to make him interesting, but strong and still vulnerable. It was finding layers to Levi and making them show through."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Christian Keyes doing now?</h2><p>The former model has kept busy since exiting Saints & Sinners in April 2018. Christian appeared on five episodes of Supernatural's 13th season and seven episodes of The CW’s Legends of Tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>He also recently starred as public defender Charlie Riggs on the BET drama In Contempt, which he found to be very different from his stint as Levi Sterling.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It was an opportunity to play a good character," he said of In Contempt. "It is a fresh and sexy take on Law & Order. I like how Charlie is flawed and he owns it. I did not want to keep playing safe characters with no issues."</p><p>Christian revealed that the experience changed his perspective of public defenders. "This show has allowed me to have more of a thorough understanding of how overworked and overloaded they are with cases," he previously explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At The Movies</a>.</p><p>"They still have a job to do, which is finding some formal justice for everyone with a few resources and time," the actor continued. "In Contempt helps me understand and respect them more."</p><p>Though Christian is no longer on Saints & Sinners, catch new episodes of the Bounce TV series on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnLnq2iZaOpsrO4yKeeZquRnru1v4yapZ1lo567r7HRrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-apostle-suleman-escapes-death-as-gunmen-attack-convoy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Apostle Suleman Escapes Death As Gunmen Attack Convoy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./41700-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>VIDEO: Senator Yerima Reveals Why He Married 13-Year-Old Girl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
