Our plan was for the project to provide at least 1,000 persons directly, both on the farm and when the processing factory takes off.</p><p>“What has happened was not a loss to we investors alone but to the 150 that were working on the farm before it was burnt and the people that we intend to engage in the processing factory, that had been delayed now even with the level of unemployment in the country.</p><p>“The governor did everything to make the project a reality. What they have burnt, was a pilot project for what we have in mind if things work well.</p><p>“The governor, the Tor Tiv, the bishop and other notable leaders and stakeholders, had empathised with us; they had intervened and had assured us that justice would be served.</p><p>“What has happened is not in the character of the people of Benue and particularly, the community, where the farm is located.</p><p>“Let me assure you that we are not going to leave the area. We are looking at what we can do when the rain starts. The project will only be delayed but we shall improve on what we have on the ground.</p><p>“The government had promised us the possibility of giving us more land and this will give us the opportunity for bigger plantation.”</p><p>Speaking earlier, the leader of the delegation, Akpe, had empathised with Obasanjo about the destruction of his mango farm, promising the former Nigerian leader that such an incident would not happen again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FvZp2do6m%2Ftq%2FToqanZZ%2Bbeq7FjKaYp5%2BfYrOivsxmoKdlkpq7trGMqZiippaquW67wZqqmqaapHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1493261-i-asake-set-portable-zazu-warns-comparing-terminator-singer-wizkid-video-trends-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I &amp;amp; Asake Are the Same Set: Portable Zazu Warns Those Comparing Terminator Singer to Wizkid, V</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-lopez-twitchstar-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chica - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tokyo-vice-total-episodes.html>How Many Episodes Is HBO Max's Crime Series 'Tokyo Vice'?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./iraj-weeraratne-html.html>Iraj Weeraratne - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-is-arthur-gunn-now.html>Where Is Arthur Gunn Now?
