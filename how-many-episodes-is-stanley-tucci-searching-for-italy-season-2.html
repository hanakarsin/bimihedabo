Stanley kicked off the sophomore season in Venice, and his coverage of cicchetti and black risotto had some viewers itching to book plane tickets, and to try the recipes out at home.</p><p>Season 2 is just getting started, but how many episodes will there be?

While the first season exclusively covered notable areas in Italy, the sophomore season will go outside of the country for one episode.</p><p>Stanley took viewers around Venice on the Season 2 premiere, and he's set to cover the Piedmont and Umbria regions in the second and third episodes, respectively. For the fourth episode, Stanley will highlight how Italian immigrants have shaped the food scene in London, England (which is The Hunger Games star's adopted hometown). The fourth episode will air on May 22.</p><p>In early 2022, the actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that the plan for the show is to cover most of the country's regions (though a couple may be consolidated, or cut out completely).</p><p>"Obviously, we're going to do the rest of the regions in Italy. We'll do five or six — people always say, 'Don't tell anybody what you're doing next,' but it's like, 'It's not that complicated to figure out! Look at the regions we did and look at the other regions. We'll do those!'" Stanley shared.</p><p>He noted that he hadn't figured out an exact order for the remaining areas.</p><p>"In what order they'll come, I have no idea, but we will do them. Will we do every single region? Not necessarily, because some of them are so tiny," he added. "We might sort of combine some and all that. But at any rate, we're proceeding ahead and trying to cover as much as possible."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stanley Tucci (@stanleytucci)</a></p></figure><p>During a Q&A on his Instagram feed, Stanley shared that he was working on five more episodes of the CNN series.
