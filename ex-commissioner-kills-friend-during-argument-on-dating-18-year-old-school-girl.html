Then yesterday (Sunday), he called the girl and told her that she should meet him at the Total filling station by 5 pm so they could go out.</p><p>“The girl informed her father, who then asked her to go as planned and that he would follow behind to ascertain the situation. As expected, Galadima was waiting at the point while the father was watching as the girl arrived.</p><p>“Galadima asked her to enter the car after he had opened the door but at that point, the father came out and confronted his friend, expressing anger. He then tried to run away, but there was a struggle between them which led to him pushing the late Adamu out of the car, he hit his head on the pavement of the road, and the back tyre of the car crushed his legs and broke the bones. He died on the way to the hospital,” the relative told newsmen.</p><h2>Khadijat Reveals What Happened</h2><p>Narrating her ordeal to journalists, Khadija, a senior secondary school student, said that the ex-commissioner got her number from her friend and had been asking her out on several occasions, but she declined.</p><p>She said: “Yesterday (Sunday) evening, Galadima called me while I was in the shop and asked me to meet him around the Yelwan Tundu market. So, I informed my father and his friend about it, and he asked me to go.</p><p>“I was in a Keke while my father took a bike; when we got there, he asked me to enter his car. I said he should wait; my father came out to confront him. They were dragging his car; he wanted to escape with me, and then I came out of the vehicle. He drove roughly with my dad’s hands in his car, trying to turn off the engine. He hit him on a pole from there, and he died.”</p><p>She alleged that Galadima zoomed off while her father’s lifeless body was lying on the road.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that the incident caused a protest in the Yelwa area on Monday morning as road users were blocked on their way to work.</p><p>Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, Army, Civil Defense and the monarch all reportedly intervened before calmness was restored in the area.</p><h2>Police Arrest</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Police</strong> </a>Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bauchi State Command, <strong>Ahmed Wakil,</strong> confirmed the incident to newsmen noting that the Commissioner of Police, Umar Sanda, has been informed of the incident.</p><p>According to the PPRO, Sanda has directed that the incident be transferred to the command headquarters for discreet investigation.</p><p>He said, “Yesterday, October 30, 2022, at about 7.30 pm, a case of fatal motor accident was transferred from the Yelwa Division for a discreet investigation, it was a case of culpable homicide.</p><p>“One Khadijah Adamu Babanta was enticed by one man, Mohammed Damina, Galadiman Dass, a 68-year-old resident of Yelwa. When Galadima enticed her, she told her father about it; then she told the father that the said man was waiting for her at a filling station.</p><p>“Her father followed her behind to the place. On getting there, the father, now deceased, confronted Galadima through the passenger’s side of his car, as they were discussing, Galadima zoomed off the vehicle while the deceased was still hanging on to the car door to point he fell and was rushed to ATBUTH for medical attention but was confirmed dead by a medical doctor.”</p><p>“On receiving the report, the Commissioner of Police, Umar Sanda directed all tactical commanders led by the Area Commander, Metro and other DPOs to the scene,”&nbsp;Wakil added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JqZp6wXZi8rrnIrKqip56av263yKWjrGWWp7amusNmm66qmaO0bq3RoKymnZ6perC6jJ2YraGenHpyhIyynJqqXaS5pXnSnJ%2Bop5xitKq%2By2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./408098-najua-itanichukua-muda-kujifunza-kazi-lakini-nitajibidiisha-seneta-mpya-wa-garissa-azungumza-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Najua Itanichukua Muda Kujifunza Kazi Lakini Nitajibidiisha, Seneta Mpya wa Garissa Azungumza</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-joel-osteen-pay-taxes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Joel Osteen Pay Taxes?
