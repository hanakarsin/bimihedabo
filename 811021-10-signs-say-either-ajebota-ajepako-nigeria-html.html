It is either you are an ‘ajebota’ or an ‘ajepako’. The ‘ajebo’ people as Nigerians often say are the ‘tush’ ones; this class of people are more inclined to act the ‘oyinbo’ way.</strong></p><p>Being wealthy most times make many people regard some people as ‘ajebota’ because of the standard of living they are used to. For some, education helps them transform totally and could make people term them ‘ajebo’.</p><p>Their ways of life many not conform to that which they grew up with after attaining a certain level of education. Technology also changes the status of some people and it helps them adjust to the trend of the society.</p><p>The people regarded to as ‘ajepako’ live ruggedly; they are able to adjust to any situation and would survive even under the hardest conditions. People believe that those born without a silver spoon fall in this group. Some people born wealthy could also show traits of an ‘ajepako’ when they decide to move away from the family business and strive for success while being independent.</p><p>That being established let us look at the things people do that make them get termed an ‘ajebota’ or ‘ajepako’ in Nigeria:</p><p class=h3>1.
