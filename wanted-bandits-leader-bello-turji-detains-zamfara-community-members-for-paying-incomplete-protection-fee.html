We used N100,000 to buy them packs of cigarette, loaves of bread, soft drinks and recharge cards as they instructed.</p><p>“Seven members of the community were mobilized and dispatched to deliver the money at an agreed spot near Kasayawa, a community located 1km east of Moriki town. After the delivery team arrived at the location, seventeen Turji’s boys rode to the spot and asked for the money and other items we bought for them.</p><p>“However, when Turji’s attention was drawn to the fact that the money brought was N10.5 million not N20 million as agreed he became angry and ordered his boys to hold five out seven members of the delivery team. He asked them to take the residents to one of his camps in Jirari forest straddling Zurmi and Shinkafi local government areas. Even though two of them escaped and arrived home this morning.</p><p>“We are now put on edge and we have started making effort to reach out to him that we will deliver the balance of N10 million to him. We are in a serious trouble as a people,” a resident, Sani Moriki, told Daily Trust.</p><p>When contacted by the publication, the spokesman of the Zamfara State Police Command, <strong>SP Muhammad Shehu</strong>, said he would find out what had actually happened.</p><h2>Military Declares Turji, 18 Others Wanted</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls on Monday, 14th November, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) unveiled <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the identities</a></strong> of nineteen (19) most wanted terrorist leaders it is tracking at the moment, including Turji.</p><p>The list released by the Director, Defence Information, Maj.-Gen.
