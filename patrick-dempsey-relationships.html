This is not to say that age-gap relationships don't last (<a href=#>Sarah Paulson</a> and Holland Taylor are still going strong), but Dempsey's marriage didn't stand the test of time.</p><p>Rocky accused Patrick of physically abusing her while on the set of Can't Buy Me Love, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>.</p><p>“While we were on the set of his (1987) movie Can’t Buy Me Love, he beat me up because he claimed he ‘wanted to see what it was like to beat up a woman!’" Rocky alleged, as seen in court papers.
